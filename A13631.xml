            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is truly ſaid (Right reuerend and my very good Lord) that a fooliſh Iudge doth ouer-haſtily giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, not rightly apprehending, or duely weighing all things belonging thereunto. An example whereof we haue both in Iewes and Gentiles, vnto whom the Goſpel preached, was a ſtumbling-blocke, and ſeemed to be a fooliſh and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd doctrine, they being carried away ſo to iudge by this haſty conceit, <hi>that a man who came himſelfe to ſhame &amp; death, could not bring others to life and glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas if they had rightly apprehended, and duely weighed and conſidered, that ſinne was a moſt ſhamefull and deadly euill, which could not, as Gods decree ſtood, bee done away, but either with the ſhame and death of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, or of ſome other party that ſhould vndertake to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie

               </gap> to life and glory; they would (I ſay) well haue vnderſtood that the Goſpell thus reuealing Chriſt Ieſus vnto us, is the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23.</note> power of God, and the wiſdome of God.</p>
            <p>And verily the Goſpell is the moſt powerfull wiſedome that euer was reuealed to man; becauſe it maketh men, that by the corrupt ſuggeſtions of Satan were made mad, &amp; <note place="margin">Luc. 15. 17. Eccl. 7. 27. 2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> put out of their right mind, wiſe to ſaluation by faith in Chriſt: yea is not the ſincere embracer of the Goſpell, the wiſeſtman that liueth on earth, ſeeing he only embraceth the right meanes whereby he may be made happy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? And is not the ſound preacher of the Goſpell, who tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the hearts of the Fathers to the children, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the wiſdome of the iuſt, and ſo maketh a people ready prepared for the Lord, the diſpoſer of the chiefeſt <note place="margin">Luc. 1. 17.</note> bleſſings that the Lord beſtoweth vpon his deareſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
            <p>And is not alſo the carefull and watchfull Biſhop, that is a guide ſet ouer the guides of the Lord's flocke, and a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent ouer the Lord's watchmen, and is to commaund that they teach no other doctrine, nor mingle wilde goards <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 3.</note> with the wholeſome food that is appointed for thoſe that <note place="margin">2 Reg. 4. 39. Tit. 1. 5.</note> are of the Lord's Family, and if any ſuch thing be done, to redreſſe the ſame, is not (I ſay) ſuch a one a ſingular, yea an honourable inſtrument vnder God; that thoſe ſo ſruitfull labours of all inferiour Miniſters, may bee made powerfull vnto many for the ſaluation of their ſoules?</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1912:3"/>
            <p>Now the labors of Miniſters are then powerfull, when the wiſdome of the word of God is made manifeſt by them, which is, when the right ſenſe thereof is explained, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by cleare and ſound arguments, and reaſons. For he that will vrge the bare and naked words of the Scripture, without the true ſenſe and meaning thereof, is like to a ſouldier that will fight with a ſcabbard without a ſword. And he that will vrge a ſenſe thereof not iuſtified &amp; clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſound and ſufficient reaſons, is like to one that will fight with a ſword without an edge. For they are the ſolid reaſons whereon the wiſe and holy doctrines of the diuine word of God are grounded, that giue light &amp; weight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and are, after a ſort, the very life thereof. And hereof it is that all manner of learned Profeſſours, eſpecially among Chriſtians, he they orthodoxe, or be they haereticks, offer to iuſtifie their ſeuerall opinions by ſound &amp; ſolid arguments concluded in true ſyllogiſmes, and to that end require pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſputations. Now if all require the truth of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions to be thus tried, then they may not in any caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and ſhame this manner of tryall.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed <note place="margin">Acts 25. 12.</note> vnto <hi>Caeſar: Haſt thou appealed vnto Caeſar? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Caeſar thou ſhalt goe:</hi> So ſay I vnto all learned Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Christianity: haue yee appealed vnto reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in true ſyllogiſmes for the iuſtifying of your ſeuerall poſitions? by reaſon ye ſhallbe tryed, and to the cenſure thereof ye ought to ſtand.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue already (Chriſtian Reader) in the two former parts of the <hi>Tryall of Truth,</hi> made it manifeſt, that the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is agreeable to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Now in this third part I endeauour to make it euident that the ſame doctrine is agreeable to all the rules of right reaſoning, &amp; therefore alſo is orthodoxe &amp; ſound: For the declaration and demonſtration of the truth of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing, is nothing els but a declaration, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of a true definition and diuiſion thereof, and of the cauſes and effects, and of all other arguments that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree thereunto; as I haue already proued in a little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, entituled <hi>The reaſonableneſſe of wiſe and holy Truth;</hi> and <hi>The abſurdity of wicked and fooliſh errour,</hi> being the fore-runner of this large Volume.</p>
            <p>Faith in holy Scripture is taken either for the quality and habit of Faith, or for the doctrine of Faith. The holy Scripture deciphereth the quality and habit of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

            <p>The principall efficient cauſe of the quality or habit of Faith, is God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. The inſtrumentall cauſe is the word of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17.

The formall cauſe is a ſure and ſettled aſſent, grounded vpon a ſure &amp; ſettled kgow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Iohn 17. 8. Col.</hi> 1. 6. The finall cauſe is the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all glorying in our ſelues, and the aſcribing of all glory vnto God <hi>Eph. 2. 8. Rom.</hi> 3. 27. The effects of Faith are, as all other diuine graces and fruits of the ſpirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. ſo an holy confidence, and an aſſurance of God's loue, and a comfortable boldneſſe to come vnto God as vnto a gracious and louing Father, <hi>Eph. 3. 12. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 10. The ſubiect wherein it is ſeated, is the mind. For the mind is the eye of the ſoule, and Faith is the true ſight thereof, <hi>Ioh. 8. 56.

            <p>This is the delineation of the whole body of Faith, as it is drawne out by the penſill of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: the parts &amp; members whereof which are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſed, are further lightned and cleared in the firſt part of this Treatiſe. As in the ſecond part thereof, the reaſons and arguments produced to open and iuſtifie the ſeueral doctrines of Faith, are referred to all the Topick places, as being the rich mines out of which they are digged.</p>
            <p>The doctrines of Faith, ſet down in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, are Logicall, reaſonable &amp; wiſe; and the very firſt principles and grounds thereof are <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2</note> without any mixture of ſophiſticall deceit. The high Prieſts pectorall, wherein the Vrim and Thummim was put, and by the which God gaue anſwer vnto his people, was called by the Hebrewes <hi>Hoſen,</hi> and by the Greekes <note place="margin">See <hi>Alſted.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1912:6"/> doctrines had in them the moſt pure holines of moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Logick, or reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Logick places which I follow in this Treatiſe, are deliuered by <hi>Petrus Ramus,</hi> who concerning the vſe of Logick hath very much cleared the rules of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> our grand Maſter.</p>
            <p>The exemplifying of Logick places by the Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call poſitions, I haue taken from <hi>Amandus Polanus,</hi> but with this difference: in that he ſetteth downe his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments declaratiue and demonſtratiue, in bare ſentences and propoſitions, without further diſcourſe; whereas in this Treatiſe they are further opened by other arguments and reaſons. For as learned and iudicious Doctour <hi>Feild</hi> auouncheth in his Dedicatory Epiſtle to his firſt Booke of the Church, the doctrines wherein we differ from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are grounded not only vpon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt authority that is, but alſo vpon the moſt preuailing reaſons that euer perſwaded men. And verily, if that moſt famous Oratours iudgment be ſound, there is no reaſon to giue credit to that reaſon, whereof there cannot bee yeelded a ſufficient reaſon. <hi>Cic. lib. 4. ad Herennium.</hi>

            <p>The great Antichriſt of theſe laſt times, (as teſtifieth <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 8.</note> the Apoſtle) which hath brought in a great Apoſtacy fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Faith, ſhalbe conſumed with the Spirit of the Lord's mouth, and ſhalbe aboliſhed with the brightneſſe of his comming: and ſo ſhall his Armies alſo, which (as <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>

For whereas the time of miracles is now long ſince expired, whereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and their ſucceſſours in the Primitiue Church, got credit to the diuine doctrine of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our moſt wiſe and learned <hi>Solomon,</hi> hath already by his penne begun this regall and Princely worke, and hath iuſtified by cleare and demonſtratiue arguments, that the ſupreme authority to command aſwell in Eccleſiaſticall as in ciuill cauſes, reſteth in the ciuill Magiſtrate in his own Dominions and Countries, and hath ſent his Booke to all Chriſtian Princes, the which (no doubt) ſhall preuail at that time, when he that hath the hearts of all Kings in his own hand, ſhall know it to be moſt fit.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould it not then highly pleaſe, eſpecially the Eccleſiaſtick Peeres of his Kingdomes, to follow ſo worthy &amp; ſupereminent an example, in cauſing all The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall doctrines in this our renowned Church, to be confirmed by cleare and demonſtratiue arguments, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficable by all the rules of ſound reaſon, and the ſophiſmes oppoſed againſt them, reduced to the elenches, as in part they haue bin already by that famous late publike Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Doctor <hi>Whitaker.</hi> And if worthy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamples of famous men of their own ranke be not to be neglected herein, haue they not to be their Precedents the ſingular Patrons of the Chriſtian Faith, that liued in the Primitiue Church, that penned their learned Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and deliuered them vp into the hands euen of the Heatheniſh perſecuting Emperours?</p>

                  <p>But as for miracles, the holy liues, and comfortable deathes of the deareſt ſeruants of God, the Lord's temporall bleſſings and corrections, the wiſdome of the Law of God, and the beſt reaſon of the naturall man, all and euery of theſe may bee as good preparatiues to cauſe vs more readily to receiue the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke of our ſoules: but the inſtructions of the wholeſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Goſpell of Chriſt are the only right Phyſicke, and the moſt ſoueraigne confections that are able to recouer our ſpirituall health and life: For if we liue an holy and an heauenly <note place="margin">Ier. 46. 1. Gal. 2. 20.</note> life, we liue ſo by the faith of the ſonne of God, who hath loued vs, and hath giuen himſelfe for vs: the which faith is wrought by the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>The former may be ſome impellent occaſions to induce ſuch as are not yet effectually called to giue an attentiue eare to the moſt wholeſome doctrines of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and to moue ſuch as are effectually called already, to hearken more readily and reuerently then before they haue done. But they are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1912:16"/> no helpes to the Goſpell it ſelfe for the working out of the converſion of any. Becauſe this word of Chriſt is not rightly receiued, nor doth worke in any one effectually, but where it <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2. 13</note> is receiued for it's own ſake.</p>
                  <p>And verily concerning the power of miracles and of the Church, which is a multitude of ſuch as profeſſe the truth, they are not able to convert an Infidell, but to prepare him, &amp; make him ready to embrace the Goſpell, which is the power of God <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16 <hi>Aug. de utilitnt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Verily God would haue all men ſaued, and come thereto by the knowledge of the truth. But this knowledge of the truth is learned out of the <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4 Ioh. 8. 32 Col. 1. 5</note> Goſpel, the word of truth. And therefore did the Lord cauſe ſo many ſtrange ſignes and wonders to be done by the firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers and preachers thereof, that the doctrine of the ſame <note place="margin">Marc. 16. 20. Hab. 2. 4.</note> might bee embraced as diuine and heauenly, whereunto the Lord himſelfe did giue ſuch teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>For the which purpoſe alſo the Lord cauſed ſo many diuine graces to ſhine in the liues, and ſuch admirable courage and comfort in the deathes, of ſuch as were the firſt Martyrs and Confeſſors in the Primitiue Church, that that doctrine might be receiued as diuine &amp; heauenly, which wrought ſuch diuine and heauenly effects. The which were ſo euident and apparent, that the very enemy was forced to giue teſtimony thereto with theſe or the like words: <hi>Theſe be they which ſpeake as they liue, and liue as they speake; this is aſſuredly an holy profeſſion, which bringeth forth ſuch an holy converſation; this is a ioyfull &amp; comfortable faith, which breedeth ſuch ioy and comfort amidſt the very terrours of death.

                  <p>So likewiſe why doth the Lord ſometimes cauſe the ſweet

And why doth he ſuffer the Field of his Church ſometimes to lye ley and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken vp, and to be at reſt, and againe at another time doth breake it vp, and fallow it; but that he might make it fitter to receiue and nouriſh the Lord's ſeed, and in the end yeeld a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter harueſt?</p>
                  <p>Yea as a wiſe and prudent Schoolemaſter dealeth with his young and tender Scholler, ſometimes ſpeaking him faire, and giuing him an apple or a fig, that ſo he may winne him vnto his will, and ſometimes not only threatneth him, but vſeth alſo the rod, that ſo he may force and compell him thereunto; ſo dealeth Chriſt our heauenly Maſter and Teacher, with vs his dull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Schollers, ſometimes ſeeking to allure vs with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall largeſſe of his temporall bleſſings, carefully to hearken to the holy inſtructions of his Word; and ſometimes ſeeking to compell vs thereto by his ſharpe corrections; the which yet <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 45 Luc. 14. 23</note> are neither our Schoole, nor our Schoolemaſter, but the rod ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our Schoolemaſters hand. The Church is our Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and Chriſt himſelfe is our Schoolmaſter; and the Bible is the Booke whereby we be taught: corrections are the rod in Chriſts hands, whereby we are forced to giue an attentiue eare to the inſtructions of his word, by the which we are made wiſe and learned Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Proſperity ordinarily breedeth ſecurity, and choaketh the <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 22. Exod. 6 9. Eccle. 7. 9 Iob. 3. 3. Ier. 15. 10.</note> good ſeed, and maketh it vnfruitfull. So aduerſity maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to murmure againſt God, and to ſtop their eares againſt all good admonitions; yea, it maketh a wiſe man mad, as it may appeare by holy <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Ieremie,</hi> who were thereby occaſioned euen to curſe the day of their nativity. And therefore it is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall bleſſing of God, when by proſperity we are ſtirred vp to thankfulnes, and by aduerſity to repentance, and to take better heed to the wholeſome inſtructions of God's moſt holy word. Bleſſed is the man (ſaid <hi>Dauid)</hi> whom thou chaſtneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt in thy Law, that thou maiſt giue him patience in <note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 12.</note>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1912:17"/> time of adverſity, vntill the pit be digged for the vngodly.</p>
                  <p>And verily when in our aduerſity the Lord doth teach vs out of his Word the vſe and end of afflictions, and maketh vs ſeriouſly to lay it to our hearts, then is our adverſity made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto vs by the bleſſing of God. I heard <hi>Ephraim</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) lamenting thus; Thou haſt corrected me, and I was chaſtiſed as an vntamed Calfe, convert thou me, and I ſhalbe converted, for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after I converted, I repented; and after I was inſtructed, I ſmote vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 18.</note> my thigh. In which words we may perceiue that correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of themſelues cauſe the profeſſed ſeruants of God to kicke with the heele, and that vntill God by his word inſtruct them, they are not effectually moued by their corrections vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment of life. Wherefore when the Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth the eares of any of his Seruants by their corrections, it is by ſending vnto them a Meſſenger one of a thouſand to declare vnto them the Lord's moſt exact righteouſnes and ſeuerity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt the ſinne of his Elect, which cannot be ſatisfied for the ſame but by the precious Bloud of their Sauior Chriſt, that thereby they might be brought to Faith and Repentance. For then will the Lord haue mercy vpon them, and ſay, Deliuer them, that they goe not downe into the pit; for I haue receiued a reconciliation. <note place="margin">Iob 33. 24.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then it is ſtill the power of the Goſpell of Chriſt, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the mouthes of his faithfull Miniſters, that is able to worke the converſion of a ſinner: afflictions may cauſe vs more carefully to giue attendance to the Word, as in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may paines &amp; penalties inflicted by the Magiſtrates, which are the Lord's Lieutenants, ordained to this purpoſe, that they ſhould by their penall ſtatutes euen force their ſubiects to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken diligently to the commandements of God.</p>
                  <p>Not that any can be forced to faith and repentance by any manner of penalty or paine whatſoeuer, but by inforcements they may be driuen to come to the Aſſemblies of the Saints, where the Fiſhers of men caſt out the net of the Goſpell, that at one time or other they may be brought within the compaſſe thereof, and ſo may be taken vp into <hi>Noah's</hi> Arke. So then ſtill
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1912:18"/> it is the net of the Goſpell, and the hooke of the Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are taken and brought vnto God: afflictions ſent of God, and penalties inflicted by the Magiſtrates, are but the baites to make ſome bite at this hooke, and poles to make them come within the compaſſe of this net.</p>
                  <p>Nay this worke of a mans vnfained conuerſion to God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wrought by the terrours of the Law of God. For the <note place="margin">Gal. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Law is the letter that condemneth and killeth, cauſing a ſinner to flie from God, as from an angry and offended Iudge. The Goſpell is the miniſtery of righteouſneſſe and life, reuealing the light of God's countenance ſhining in <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 4.</note> Chriſt, and opening his Fatherly affection and loue, whereby he draweth his Elect vnto him.</p>
                  <p>The moſt that the Law of God can effect either by the ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the holy precepts thereof, or by the ſeuerity of the threatnings denounced therein, is happily for a time to ſtay ſin, vndoubtedly it hath not power enough to ſlay it: it may ſtop for a while the current of ſin, &amp; cut down ſome of the boughs thereof, but it cannot empty the fountaine of ſin, nor pluck it vp by the very rootes.</p>
                  <p>Much leſſe can humane wiſdome worke the reformation of ſinfull men, it may make them perhaps couer their ſinnes, but <note place="margin">

                  <p>For the reaſon and the wiſedome of the naturall man could not finde out many particular tranſgreſſions committed againſt the Law of God, nor ſound the depth of his iudgments, much leſſe could it reach to the height of his mercies, and the moſt ſtrange and incredible expiation that the Lord appointed for ſinne. This Myſtery required a ſupernaturall reuelation, and could not be reuealed but by the doctrin of the Goſpel. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the world by her wiſedome, knew not God in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1912:18"/> wiſedome of God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching, to ſaue them that belieue. For the Goſpell is the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full voice of our great Shepheard, whereby he calleth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calleth <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21, Ioh. 10. 3.</note> all his wandring ſheepe, and bringeth them home to his owne fold. The Goſpell is the banner of Chriſt, whereby hee bringeth back his fugitiue ſouldiers, and draweth them to his <note place="margin">Can. 2. 4. Mar. 1. 17.</note> owne colours. The Goſpell is the net which plucketh vs vp out of the Sea of our ſinnes, and pulleth vs into Chriſt's ſhip, and waffeth vs along to the ſafe hauen of our euerlaſting happines in the Kingdome of Heauen. The Goſpell is that voyce of Chriſt that raiſeth vs vp out of the death of ſinne, to the life of <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 25.</note> righteouſneſſe; yea it is that <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> that water of life that worketh in vs an holy life, and quickneth vs to euerlaſting <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 14</note> life.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpell is that Zephyrus, that life-breathing winde <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 16.</note> that blowing vpon Chriſt's Garden, cauſeth the ſpices thereof to flow out. The Goſpell hath in it thoſe ſweet deawes and ſhowers, which dropping down vpon the dry grounds of our hearts, cauſeth them to yeeld a plentifull harueſt: The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 2.</note> of the Goſpel are thoſe good ſciences, that being graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our hearts, make vs to become fruitfull trees, meete to be planted in the Paradiſe of God.

Wherefore let <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14.</note> Iew and Gentile, and whatſoeuer Heretickes preach only, or at leaſt principally the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Law of nature and Nations, becauſe they acknowledge not the imputed righteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes

For as the right ſenſe of the Word of God, maketh it to be the true Word of God; ſo a wrong ſenſe forged by man, maketh it to be the word of man: yea a curſed gloze thereof, made by the ſuggeſtion of that curſed ſerpent Satan, cleane corrupteth the Text, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that which in the ſyllables and words is the very Word of God, to be in the corrupt ſenſe, the very word of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſuch as be carefull not to fall into errour, nor to turne the Word of God into the Word of the Diuell, muſt <note place="margin">Tertul. adverſ.

For the word profiteth not vnleſſe it bee <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note> mixed with Faith, Now a right faith ſtandeth vpon a true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of that we beleeue. For we cannot giue a right aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of faith to that which we doe not rightly vnderſtand. And therefore the weaker or ſtronger our apprehenſion of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Word of God is, the weaker or ſtronger is our Faith; As it appeareth in the very Apoſtles themſelues, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with Chriſt himſelfe, and being oft taught by him the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of godlines, yet were a long time very weake in Faith, for that they were very weake in knowledge. But when our bleſſed Sauiour after his reſurrection had opened their minds, and had made them to vnderſtand the ſenſe of the Scriptures, <note place="margin">Luc. 24. 45</note> then they attained to a greater meaſure of Faith. For growth in the right knowledge of the word of grace, doth bring with <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18.</note> it growth in grace it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is no meane mercy, when God doth beſtow vpon any perſons, the true and certaine knowledge of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdome of God, ſeeing it is a ſure ſigne that he <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 11.</note> hath admitted all ſuch into the couenant of grace, in whoſe hearts hee hath written his holy Lawes, by giuing them the right vnderſtanding of them. For the ſoule of man is as a Table <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 31. 2 Cor. 3 3. Prov. 7. 3.

And therefore when the diuine doctrine of the Word of God is rightly apprehended by our vnderſtanding, and firmely layed vp and ſettled in our memory, it is (as it were) printed and grauen in our ſoules, &amp; ſo doth thereby aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For giue in ſincerity entertainment in the beſt roomes of thy ſoule to the Word of God, and thou doſt <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 23 Eph. 3. 17.</note> withall giue entertainment to Chriſt. For Chriſt doth dwell in our hearts by Faith. He is not receiued and eaten with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily mouthes, becauſe he is not our bodily food, but with the mouthes of our ſoules, when ſweetly and profitably we lay vp in our memories, that his fleſh was wounded and pierced for <note place="margin">Aug. de doct.

                  <p>So <hi>Tertullian:</hi> Chriſt is deuoured by hearing, chewed by vnderſtanding, and digeſted by beleeuing. For reall things are not in our mindes by any corporall contiguity of their reall ſubſtances, but by a ſpirituall participation of them by their <note place="margin">Res non ſunt in animis, ſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum notiones.</note> reall notions. Neither doe our Sacraments auouch a mingling of perſons, or an vniting of ſubſtances, but after a ſpirituall and a myſticall manner, And therefore Chriſt's Body being not a bodily, but a ghoſtly food, is not receiued but by the powers of our ſoules, being indued with a true Faith.</p>

                  <p>As for example, the Lord worketh a care in many naturall men, to lead a ciuill and a righteous life, by cauſing them to apprehend and embrace thoſe arguments and reaſons which are of force to perſwade to a ciuill and a righteous life.

                  <p>Inſomuch that the minds of the Faithfull are firſt ſanctified <note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> by a true and right apprehenſion of the loue of God in Chriſt, made manifeſt vnto them by the light of the Goſpell, and their wills are inflamed with a ſeruent deſire to be partakers thereof before they be made the ſincere Seruants of Chriſt.

                  <p>Wherefore it behooueth the faithfull to giue all diligence to worke out their ſaluation, not only with hearts trembling at their owne imperfections, but alſo by being fearefull to aſcribe to themſelues the glory of willing or working any thing that is good, ſeeing (as the Apoſtle adioyneth) it is God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> in you the will and the deed, and that of his own goodwill.

                  <p>WHereas the Word of God profiteth not vnleſſe it bee <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2</note> mingled with Faith: that is, vnleſſe it being rightly vnderſtood, procure a wiſe and a ſettled aſſent, it ſtandeth all in hand to ſeeke out the true meanes, whereby they may come to the right vnderſtanding thereof, if that they deſire to reape any benefit thereby.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, that the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts, being the Lord's Secretaries, or Regiſters to ſet down in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all diuine and heauenly doctrines, neceſſary to ſaluation, were inſtructed by the immediate revelation of the Spirit of God, that ſo they might be freed therin from all errour. But for any other perſon to challenge the ſame priuiledge, were but a phantaſticall and an Anabaptiſticall illuſion. For euen the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelfe, who is magnified by his followers as the only man that hath all diuine and humane Lawes locked vp
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1912:25"/> in his breſt, and is by them accounted the only vnerring Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of holy Scripture, and the infallible Iudge of the right ſenſe and meaning thereof; yet is by his chiefeſt Vpholders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the meanes, without the which he muſt not looke to attaine to the right and true vnderſtanding thereof. The high Biſhop (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> muſt not expect revelations, but vſe <note place="margin">

For [as <hi>Canus</hi> affirmeth) the holy Writers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe Catholick doctrines by the immediate revelation and inſpiration of God, and therefore needed not outward helpes thereunto: Whereas it behoueth Biſhops to vſe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe by weighing of reaſons, and by imploying their diligence.</p>

And therfore whereas we ought to giue the fulleſt aſſent to all doctrines of piety and godlines, which are deliuered in the Word of God, we ought moſt diligently to ſearch out the ſtrongeſt reaſons, that may throughly induce &amp; perſwade thereunto. For (as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> teſtifieth) the Goſpell <note place="margin">

And vndoubtedly by arguments and reaſons, all truths are not only lightned and cleared, but alſo iuſtified and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

Seeing then reaſons and arguments are the cauſes of truth, we are to ſeek out the right reaſons of all things, if that we will come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
                  <p>There is much obſcurity (ſaith S. <hi>Baſil)</hi> in the diuine books; but if with the hand of the minde thou doſt knocke at the gate of the Scripture, and doſt diligently ſift thoſe places that are hidden, by litle and litle thou ſhalt beginne to vnderſtand the reaſon of the things that are ſpoken, and it ſhalbe opened vnto thee, not by any other but by the word it ſelfe, vnto the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure whereof we ought all to ſtand: For all things are cleare &amp; euldent in the Scriptures to ſuch as with an holy diſcourſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon, will heare the Word of God. For as the eye
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1912:26"/> of the body doth diſcerne the differences of all viſible things by the light of the ſunne: ſo the eye of the minde doth diſcerne the differences of all intelligible things by the ſtreaming beams of true reaſon, proceeding from Chriſt, the Sunne of all true wiſdome and vnderſtanding. And therefore in all Vniuerſities and Schooles of good learning, where wiſdome and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth is ſought for after the beſt manner, in all Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, diſputations, and conferences, not only errours are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, and doubtfull things opened, but confeſſed truths alſo are further cleered and confirmed by arguments and reaſons.</p>

And verely faith is not to be iudged by the perſons, but the perſons by the faith.

So the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> in his reſcript: credit is to be giuen to him that giueth the teſtimony, and not to the bare teſtimony: And verely we doe not embrace the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God ſet downe in the bookes of the Scriptures with that reuerent manner as we ought to doe, vnleſſe when wee giue aſſent thereunto, we dee it not ſo much for the bare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony it ſelfe, as for that it is the teſtimony of the moſt wiſe and holy God, which cannot deceiue or be deceiued: For then we rightly honour him and his truth. Hereof it was that Chriſt receiued not the witneſſe of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as it was the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proceeding from a meere man: but he receiued it as the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 33.</note> of ſuch a man as was indued with the Spirit of <hi>Eliah,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1912:28"/> and ſent before himſelfe to prepare his way. Nay, he ſaith of his owne bare and naked teſtimony conſidered by it ſelfe; If I ſhould beare witneſſe of my ſelfe, my witneſſe were not true. <note place="margin">Ioh 5. 31.</note> And yet concerning the ſame, as it is the teſtimony of the Son of God, the very eſſentiall wiſedome of his heauenly Father, he ſaith, though I beare record of my ſelfe, my record is true: <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 14.</note> for I know whence I came, and whither I goe. And hereof it is, that both God and Chriſt are ſo often mentioned in the holy Scripture with their honourable Titles, that ſo the credibility of their perſons, may yeeld the more and greater credit to their Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Andy et as if this were not ſufficient inough, the very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it ſelfe that proceedeth from God, and is ſet downe in the holy Scripture, is cleared and iuſtified by many arguments and reaſons. And verily how otherwiſe could the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inable the wiſe and learned profeſſors of the Chriſtian Faith, to confute all Heatheniſh and haereticall errours, and to iuſtifie all Divine and Heauenly Truthes, not onely to the Gentiles, and Haeretickes, but alſo to the faithfull themſelues, vnleſſe it did miniſter plenty of all ſound and evident argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the effecting of the ſame? The Gentiles refuſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of the Canonicall Scriptures, and the Haeretickes reiect the right and orthodoxall ſenſe of them; and therefore neither of them can be convicted, but by the euidence of reaſon: yea, how can the faithfull themſelues giue a ſure aſſent vnto the Doctrines of the holy Scriptures, vnleſſe they apprehend ſuch arguments and reaſons, as are ſufficient motiues to induce them thereunto? And hereof it is, that in all ſound and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Sermons, made either to breed, or to encreaſe and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Faith vnto the doctrines obſerued in the words of the Text: there are annexed ſound and ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the opening and confirming of the ſame doctrines. And this is the cauſe why preaching is preferred before rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Catechiſing, as being the more ordinary meanes both to beget and ſtrengthen Faith; for that in preaching many reaſons are produced as many lights for the better clearing and iuſtifying of all Truthes, and for the fuller convincing of all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1912:28"/> errours and haereſies, the which thing is not done either in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or in Catechizing.</p>
                  <p>There is, I confeſſe, no efficient cauſe of Gods will, but his will it ſelfe: for there is nothing without God that maketh him to will or to worke: for then God ſhould not be the firſt mouer, and the firſt cauſe of all things; but therefore he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 19.</note> becauſe he willeth. And yet farre be it from any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart, to thinke that the moſt wiſe God, willeth any thing without good and ſufficient reaſon; or that he ſpeaketh any thing idlely, or in vaine. The Word of the Lord, is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1. 5.</note> of Wiſedome: and therefore openeth all Divine truthes by their right and proper reaſons. And all the workes of God are done in number, weight, and meaſure: he hath giuen to euery ſeverall creature according to it's kinde, it's ſeuerall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with properties &amp; qualities fitted thereunto. And he hath ordained euery thing to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt of ſuch &amp; ſuch cauſes, faculties, &amp; powers, as were beſt agreeing to ſuch &amp; ſuch things, &amp; moſt powerfull to enable them to produce ſuch and ſuch effects, for the producing whereof, they were ordained by God. The which cauſes and effects, powers and faculties, qualities and properties when they are found out; then there is a right knowledge of the things themſelues. Now what are cauſes and effects, powers, qualities, and the like, but reaſons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments whereby all things are made open and manifeſt, and ſo are rightly apprehended and knowne.</p>
                  <p>Looke we into the ſacred Scriptures, and we may ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in how the Lord doth lay open vnto his people, the myſteries of godlineſſe; yea, euen that great myſtery of godlineſſe, God manifeſted in the fleſh, being the principall ſubiect of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bookes: by aſſigning his efficient cauſe, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. and his Mother the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the daughter of <hi>David</hi> the King, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 31.

                  <p>The principall parts of the Word of God, are the Law and <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 2.</note> Goſpel, both of which are grounded vpon the evidence of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and truth. Law (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is the higeſt reaſon: The <note place="margin">Cic. l. 1. de. leg.</note> which if it be true of the wiſe Lawes made by wiſe men, much more is it true of the moſt wiſe and righteous Lawes made by <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 8.</note> the moſt wiſe and righteous God. And verily it is the reaſon of the Law, that is the life of the Law, and bindeth the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to yeeld obedience. For if the Law be contrary to reaſon, it bindeth ſuch as are ſubiect thereunto, onely to endure the penalty thereof, and not to performe the thing therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. For (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith) if a Law will not be tryed <note place="margin">Tert. in Apol. Quod ad omnes attinet ab oin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus debet approbari.</note> it is iuſtly ſuſpected, and if it being not tryed and approued, yet is forced vpon any, it is wicked, ſeeing no Law doth owe to it ſelfe the iuſtifying of the equity thereof, but to them of whom it doth require obedience.</p>
                  <p>And therefore wiſe and moderate Princes doe vſe to call together a generall aſſembly of all the States and Commons of their Kingdomes, that vpon iuſt cauſes and reaſons, duely weighed and examined, both hurtfull Lawes may he taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and holſome Statutes enacted for the generall good of their Kingdomes and Countries. The which Statutes when they are publiſhed, are many times ſet forth barely without their reaſons, leaſt happily they might grow into too great a Volume: But it is not ſo with the Lawes of God, eſpecially with thoſe of the firſt Table, for they haue ſundry reaſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to them, as lights to make manifeſt the aequity of them, and as Orators, to perſwade obedience thereunto. And verily there was great reaſon why it ſhould be ſo, ſeeing by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the true knowledge of them is greatly defaced in all his poſterity. Whereas the Lawes of the ſecond Table which concerne our duty towards our neighbour, are for the moſt part barely deliuered, becauſe they are knowne by their owne light, and that to the moſt barbarous people that liue on the face of the whole earth. As it may appeare by the Hiſtory of the Weſt-Indinas, who are reported preſently to haue appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and embraced the aequity of thoſe Lawes, when they were at the firſt propoſed vnto them.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1912:30"/>
                  <p>And yet behold how behoouefull it is euen for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full themſelues to haue many reaſons ſet downe before their eyes, for the procuring of ready obedience to be yeelded euen vnto theſe commandements: in that the Spirit of God hath cauſed the Prophets and Apoſtles, being the expounders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to ſet downe in their Canonicall writings, many moſt forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and effectuall argument, for the procuring of a more ready obedience to the ſame. And verily experience it ſelfe doth ſhew <note place="margin">Veritas docen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſuadet.</note> that truth doth teach by perſwaſion, that is, by arguments and reaſons, as being ſuch motiues and inducements: as beſt befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the reaſonable and generous nature of man. Whereas brute <note place="margin">Generoſus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus poti us du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur quam trahitur.</note> beaſts that want reaſon, are to be compelled by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And therefore the Law of God in the originall is called <hi>Thorah,</hi> that is, a Doctrine or Teaching, for that it doth teach and inſtruct the people of God by the Divine aequity and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is contained therein.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Law of God which is in part naturally knowne had need to be further opened by arguments and reaſons, how much more had the doctrine of the Goſpell, which is aboue the reach of naturall reaſon? S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath deliuered certaine reaſons why it was iuſt and right, that God ſhould willingly ſuffer the fall of the firſt man; whereof the principall one is the manifeſtation of his infinite and endleſſe mercy and goodneſſe in providing that ſtrange and admirable meanes of mans reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very which is reuealed in the Goſpell. We (ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auſtin)</hi>

Firſt, after what ſort their free-will would worke, and then what the benefit of his owne grace could effect, and alſo how farre the ſeuerity of his Iuſtice would extend it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>In which words, three things are deliuered, why God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the fall of man. Firſt, that it might be knowne that the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1912:30"/> moſt excellent among the creatures, being but in a meaſure capable of goodneſſe, may fall away from the ſame: Whereas the Creator onely being infinitely good, cannot but continue ſo for euer. Secondly, that it might be made manifeſt, that there is no euill ſo great, but that the Lord can prouide in his endleſſe goodneſſe, a remedy for the ſame. Thirdly, alſo that it might be knowne, that there is no ſinne committed by any one whatſoeuer, but that God in his Iuſtice will puniſh the ſame with all ſeverity. So then God appointed this ſtrange meanes of mans recouery, that is reuealed in the Goſpell, both that he might make manifeſt the ſeuerity of his Iuſtice, in that rather then the ſinnes of his Elect and choſen children ſhould eſcape vnpuniſhed, he puniſhed them with that ſeverity vpon their kind ſuerty, that it made him ſweat water and blood: as likewiſe that he might make known the vnſearchable riches of his endleſſe goodneſſe, in that to ſpare vs moſt wicked Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Apoſtataes, he ſpared not his owne moſt dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Sonne. That herein we might behold the omnipotent power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe of God, in that out of ſinne the euill of all euils, procured by the moſt wicked ſuggeſtion of Satan, to this end that God might be diſhonoured in the higheſt degree, and man vtterly ouerthrowne and deſtroyed, the Lord hath not onely drawne vnto himſelfe the higheſt meaſure of moſt admirable glory in his ſtrange Iuſtice, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable mercy, but alſo the greateſt happineſſe to man, by binding him moſt nearely vnto himſelfe, by the ſtrongeſt bonds of the greateſt loue that could be, and in giuing him the greateſt aſſurance of his euerlaſting ſaluation. So that in reſpect thereof, we may rightly breake out with that ancient Father, into this ſtrange exclamation. O happy fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the cauſe of ordayning ſo ſtrange and admirable a meanes for mans recouery.</p>
                  <p>And how can wee thinke that the truthes of the Law and the Goſpell, want ſound and ſufficient arguments and reaſons to iuſtifie their holy and heauenly Doctrines; ſeeing no Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Haereticks, or Schiſmaticks, will ſeeme ſo abſurd and void of iudgement, but that they will pretend ſome ſhew of reaſon,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1912:31"/> for the better colouring of their erronious vntruthes. As it is apparant by the common practiſe of all the profeſſors of euery blind devotion and wicked ſuperſtition. The Idolatrous Iewes <note place="margin">Ier. 44. 17.</note> alleadged in the defence of their Idolatries: So haue done both we and our Fathers, our Kings and our Princes, in the Cities of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and in the ſtreets of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> and then had we plenty of victuals, and felt none euill; but ſince wee left off to burne incenſe to the Queene of heauen, and to poure out drinke offerings vnto her, we haue had ſearceneſſe of all things, and haue beene conſumed by ſword and by famine. And at another time, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of <note place="margin">Ier. 7. 4. Ier. 18. 18.</note> the Lord. And againe the Law ſhall not periſh from the Prieſt, nor counſell from the wiſe, nor the word fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prophets.

And againe, our life is ſhort and tedious, and in the death of a man, there is no recouery, neither was any knowne to haue returned from the graue: For we are borne at all peraduenture, and we ſhall be hereafter as if we had neuer beene: for the breath is as a ſmoake in the Noſtrils, and the words are as a ſparke raiſed out of the heart, which being extinguiſhed, the body is turned into aſhes, and the ſpirit vaniſheth as the ſoft ayre: Come therefore let vs enioy the pleaſures that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Yea, the very Omnifidian who followeth faith, not for conſcience, but for company, who will take no manner of paine to ſeeke out the true faith, by ſearching after the grounds thereof, is not thus madde without ſome ſhew or ſhadow of reaſon. For (ſaith he) I am an vnlearned man, and am to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my Calling, and to leaue the diſcuſſing of quaeſtions of learning to the learned. I am ready to come to Church, and to doe my duty to God, and to liue iuſtly and peaceably with my neighbours. Why? the learned themſelues cannot agree about the points of Faith: and how then ſhall ſuch an one as I am be able to diſcerne it, and to finde it out?</p>
                  <p>The truth is, that God wrote his Law in the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> and thereby ſet in his minde ſuch a light of reaſon, that he had a right iudgement in all things: But <hi>Adam</hi> was not contented with this treaſure of wiſdome, and this meaſure of knowledge extending it ſelfe to all that was good, but he would needes know euill alſo; that he might by experience try what would be the event thereof. And thereupon he forſooke God the Father of light, and betooke himſelfe to be inſtructed by the Prince of darkeneſſe. Whereby it came to paſſe, that he fell from truth to falſhood, from faith to fancy, from the knowledge of good to the knowledge of euill, from the light of Diuine lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke and reaſon, to divelliſh ſophiſtry. Yea, hereby the wily and crafty Serpent ſtored him and his poſterity with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of captious and deceiuable ſophiſmes, and ſo enabled him not onely to know, but alſo colourably to defend all falſhood and vntruth.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the which ſo deſperate a miſchiefe, the Lord proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſoueraigne remedy, by cauſing all Diuine verities neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation, lightned &amp; fortified with all manner of ſound arguments and reaſons to be deliuered to his Church; firſt, by word of mouth, and afterward by writing in the bookes of the Canonicall Scripture, that ſo, when the enemy ſhould come ready furniſhed, and prepared with ſtrong deluſion, and with all deceiueableneſſe of vnrighteouſneſſe, the deſender of the Truth on the contrary ſide might alſo be armed with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of weapons offenſiue and defenſiue, that ſo he might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled

                  <p>It is recorded of <hi>Themantes</hi> a Painter, that herein conſiſted the excellency of his skill, in that out of his draughts, many more things were to be collected, then were therein fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, euen ſo is it to be ſeene in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, which draw out vnto vs the moſt liuely image of the moſt gracious and glorious God, and of his moſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and beautifull workes, wherein albeit at the firſt view, and in their outward ſhew there be nothing offered to our ſight, worthy of any great admiration, yet when they are throughly viewed and looked into; it is ſtrange, and almoſt incredible what great delight will be raiſed vp by the due view of that profound wiſdome, which doth lie hid vnder a bare (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) and a naked narration.

                  <p>And verily, <hi>Moſes</hi> being learned in all the wiſdome of the Aegyptians, was thereby made mighty in words and deeds, or at the leaſt was not a little holpen thereby in all his great
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1912:36"/> and weighty affaires. As <hi>Daniel</hi> being inſtructed in all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">Dan. 1. 17.</note> and being taught the tongue and learning of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, became ten times wiſer than all the Inchanters and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologians of Babylon, and was alſo ſtrengthened and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the feare and ſeruice of the true God, more than any other that liued in his time. And did not our Sauiour Chriſt giue to his Apoſtles, the firſt Preachers and Publiſhers of his Goſpell in all the world, by the immediate worke of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <note place="margin">Act. 4. 13.</note> (for they were by education ſimple and vnlearned) ſuch a <note place="margin">Luke 21. 15.</note> mouth and wiſdome, that all their aduerſaries were not able to reſiſt? And did he not alſo giue to the firſt renewers and reuiuers of the Goſpell in theſe latter dayes, ſuch knowledge in the tongues, and in all manner of Diuine and humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by bleſſing their great labours and paines, in the diligent vſing of the meanes for the obtaining thereof, that thereby they became moſt notable lights throughout all the Countreys and Kingdomes of Chriſtendome? For they which haue the greateſt light in themſelues, are the fitteſt perſons to lighten others; and they that beſt apprehend the grounds and reaſons of all humane and diuine verities, can beſt informe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme others in all manner of doctrines, both humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine. As it may appeare by the parable of the Talents, where <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 16.</note> it is aſſumed, that he that receiued fiue Talents, went and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with them, and gained other fiue, as he that receiued two gained other two.</p>
                  <p>And yet it may not be denied, but that it may come to paſſe, that he that hath the meaner gifts, may doe the more good, and ſometimes perſwade with more fruit. As in the Councell of Nice, when all the learned Biſhops could not <note place="margin">

For as all the lights in the world cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs in our way, if we our ſelues be blinde and want our ſight; or as all the medicines in the world cannot reſtore health, if that our diſeaſed ſtomackes will not receiue them ſo the light of Gods word, be it neuer ſo cleerely and neuer ſo directly ſet before vs, cannot guide vs to God as long as we remaine in our naturall blindneſſe, and ſhut our eyes againſt the ſame. Neither can all the balme of Gilead cure our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <note place="margin">Iere. 8. 22.</note> ſores, if that we will not indure to haue it applied vnto them.</p>
                  <p>All meanes are nothing be they neuer ſo good, without the ſpeciall bleſſing of God; as on the contrary ſide, when it <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 7.</note> ſhall pleaſe God to bleſſe the meanes, they ſhall preuaile be they neuer ſo meane. And verily, as in bodily wars it is as eaſie with God to ſaue with few as with many (albeit ordinarily the ſtrongeſt army, &amp; the beſt furniſhed, winneth the field and getteth the victory) ſo in our ſpirituall warfare againſt infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuperſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet as the better meanes are the better bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God, ſo ordinarily by his diſpoſition and prouidence, they doe obtaine the better effect. As it is manifeſt in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who for that they were indued with the greateſt meaſure of all diuine and heauenly wiſedome, conuerted more to the faith of Chriſt then any other of their ſucceſſours.</p>
                  <p>As did likewiſe thoſe principall men, which were in theſe laſt dayes raiſed vp by God to be the reuiuers of his gracious Goſpell, ſpread abroad in a ſhort time the bright beames thereof in many countreys of this Weſt and North parts of the world. <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellowes may be better nouriſhed with courſe poulſe, then ſome other with a good portion of finer food, brought vnto them from the Kings owne table: and ſo ſome perſons may be better edified with a plaine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of truth, lightened with one or two teſtimonies out of the word of God, then by a great cloud of the ſame witneſſes, and by many ſtrong &amp; forcible demonſtrations; but the cauſe hereof, is either in the weakneſſe of the ſpirituall ſtomacke,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1912:37"/> vnto the which milke doth better agree then ſtrong meat: and in the dimneſſe of the ſpirituall eye, which can ſee better with a little light then with a great, or in the extraordinary worke of God. For ordinarily, the greater number and the bigger lights doe giue the greater and bigger light, as the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſtronger food doth yeeld the better and ſtronger nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Preachers of the word of God being the Lords ſtewards, and the diſpoſers of the myſteries of God, who are therefore ſet ouer the Lords houſe, that they ſhould giue to euery one their portion of food in due ſeaſon: had need to prouide good ſtore of ſpirituall graine to be laid vp before hand in the baines of their inlarged hearts, that therewith they may feed the Lords people to the full. As likewiſe for that they are the Lords Captaines to marſhall his bands and companies againſt the Lords and their owne enemies, they ought to be furniſhed with all manner of ſpirituall armour, that ſo they may be able to furniſh other. And verily, for any one to take vpon him to diſcourſe and reaſon without ſound and apt reaſons, and to argue without ſubſtantiall and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent arguments, is to take vpon him to feed without food, to fight without weapon, to lighten a thing without light, and to build without morter, timber, and ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the moſt wiſe God hath moſt prudently proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the moſt plentifull inſtruction both of Prieſt and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not only by ſetting downe in his two bookes of nature and grace, all doctrines neceſſary for their ſaluation, with great variety of all manner of reaſons and arguments, for the better clearing and confirming of the ſame; but alſo by often repeating and inculcating of them: yea, by vrging them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe; he hath giuen them a plaine admonition, that they ſhould be moſt diligent to learne thoſe thing, ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe, which he hath beene ſo carefull ſo often to teach. Verily, if we were ſuch as we ſhould be, it ſhould be ſufficient for vs, that the Lord did barely and onely in the booke of the Canonicall Scriptures, deliuer the ſeuerall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of all diuine vereties, giuing teſtimony to each of them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1912:37"/> but once by the pen of one of his vnerring Secretaries; ſeeing when God ſpeaketh any thing, albeit it be but once, we ought <note place="margin">Chryſ. aduerſus vituperatores monaſticae vitae.</note> to receiue it with all aſſurance, as if it had beene ſpoken often times. For although when humane teſtimonies are required, in the mouth of two or three witneſſes euery word muſt be eſtabliſhed, and to him that bringeth not a ſufficient number <note place="margin">1 Tim 6. 19.</note> of deponents, it is by ſtrict law, as if he had brought none: yet for that God is true and cannot lie, nor beare witneſſe to any falſhood or vntruth, or command any thing that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous or vniuſt; therefore in his word which is the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foundation of truth, if he giue teſtimony to any thing but once vnder the hand of one of his faithfull regiſters, it is as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, as if he had teſtified the ſame by them all.</p>
                  <p>For if <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his <hi>he ſaid it,</hi> was enough to his ſcholers, for that he was a moſt learned and wiſe Philoſopher: and the <note place="margin">Ipſe dixit.</note> Centurions <hi>come, goe, and doe this,</hi> was ſufficient to his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 9.</note> and ſeruants, for that he was a moſt conſcionable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander: yea, if the Kings <hi>witneſſe my ſelfe,</hi> be a full warrant <note place="margin">Teſte meipſo.</note> to all his grants, becauſe of his ſupereminent power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; then much more the <hi>he ſaid it</hi> of the moſt high God ought to be ſufficient to his diſciples, and all that be of his ſchoole; and the <hi>come, goe,</hi> and <hi>doe this</hi> of the moſt righteous Commander and Iudge of the whole world, ought to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to worke a moſt ready and ſpeedy obedience in all his true and faithfull ſeruants: and the <hi>witneſſe my ſelfe</hi> of the King of kings, and Lord of lords ought to be taken as a moſt full warrant to all his grants, by all his loyall and faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore herein we may behold the ſtrange proceeding of our moſt great and glorious God, remitting after a ſort his owne right, and ſubmitting himſelfe in his great goodneſſe to our weakneſſe, and in his high and endleſſe wiſdome proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a gracious remedy for our infirmity. For becauſe we are blinde to conceiue, and ſlow to beleeue, and hard to learne, and ready to forget the holy myſteries of piety and godlines: therefore the Lord hath cauſed not onely doctrines, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and arguments to be ſet downe at once in the booke of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1912:38"/> the diuine Scriptures, but he hath made them to be reitterated againe and againe, that thereby they may become lights to our vnderſtanding, ſtayes to our faith, and helps to our fraile and weake memory. So that albeit we are by nature neuer ſo dull and blockiſh, yet the ſame leſſons being often repeated, and opened, and cleered againe and againe, we ſhall be thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by Gods bleſſing, ſufficiently to conceiue, and faithfully keepe them in good remembrance. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreames were <note place="margin">Gen. 41. 32.</note> doubled vnto him, that the thing opened therein might get of him the better credit, ſo the inſtructions of faith, and an holy life are doubled and trebled in holy Scripture, that they might procure of vs a fuller faith. So and ſo good is our gracious God vnto vs, which are ſo and ſo vnworthy of the leaſt of his mercies, that as he hath ſtored the earth with great variety of bodily food and phyſicke, for the preſeruing and recouering of the life &amp; health of our bodies; ſo he hath prouided in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures great abundance of ſpirituall food and phyſicke for the maintenance and reſtitution of the life and health of our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>One kinde of bodily food, and one kinde of dreſſing doth not ſauour alike to euery ſtomacke, and therefore God hath prouided variety of both: ſo one motiue to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor the deliuery thereof after one manner doth fit euery ones ſpirituall taſte and ſtomacke, therefore hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained great abundance of both. Yea, as the Lord gaue ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſignes and wonders to be done by the hands of his ſeruant <hi>Moſes</hi> before the eies of the children of Iſrael, that therby they <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 8.</note> might vnderſtand that he was called &amp; ſent of God to be their deliuerer out of the bondage of Aegypt, &amp; that to this very end and purpoſe, that if they would not beleeue nor obey the voice of the firſt ſigne, yet they might be induced thereto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſecond or the third: So doth the Lord furniſh the Preachers of the Goſpell, whom he hath appointed to bee miniſters of his mercy, for the deliuerance of his people out of the ſpirituall captiuity of ſinne and Satan, with great variety of forcible and powerfull motiues and perſwaſions to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith, that if ſome of the ſame will not worke and preuaile with them, yet other may.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1912:38"/>
                  <p>For the which purpoſe alſo, he hath cauſed the myſteries of godlineſſe to be ſet downe, not onely in common and vſuall phraſes, but alſo in Metaphores and Allegories, and hath lightned them with ſimilitudes and reſemblances, apparent and manifeſt to the moſt ſimple. So the Apoſtle teacheth, that the <note place="margin">1 Cor 15 36.</note> dead ſhall riſe to life and glory by the reſemblance of ſeed, that after a ſort rotteth and death in the ground, before it ſpringeth vp and groweth to maturity and ripeneſſe. So elſewhere he prooueth the vnprofitableneſſe of ſpeaking in an vnknowne <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 1.</note> tongue, by the trumpet; which if it giue an vncertaine ſound, none ſhall be prepared to the warre, and by ſome o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>her the like things. So he likewiſe proueth, that the faithfull ought not to ſeeke for life and ſaluation by the works of the Law, ſeeing <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 15.</note> God hath couenanted to giue it to them in Chriſt Ieſus: ſeeing to a mans couenant or teſtament, when it is once made, nothing ought to be added or detracted from the ſame; much leſſe to the Couenant of God. So our Sauiour teacheth, that they are <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 23.</note> the holy doctrines of his good and gratious Word, that cauſeth our hearts to be good and gracious, euen as it is pure and good feed, that maketh the ground bring forth pure and good fruit. And verily, our bleſſed Sauiour did illuſtrate with parables all <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 34</note> his diuine inſtructions which he gaue vnto the people, as being the beſt meanes to bring them to the knowledge of the truth, and to their euerlaſting ſaluation, which is procured thereby. For (as our Sauiour himſelfe ſpeaking thereof, ſaith) if I teach <note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> you earthly things (that is, heauenly doctrines by earthly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes) and ye beleeue not, how ſhould ye beleeue if I tell you of heauenly things? that is, after an high and heauenly manner.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1912:39"/> ſtirred vp, and doth apprehend the thing the better, being ſet foorth as it were in a picture. This kinde of opening things is moſt pleaſing, and ſticketh faſter; for a ſimilitude or relem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance (if it be apt or ſit) doth ſhew forth much wiſedome, Yea, no man doubteth (as ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtine)</hi> but by para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <note place="margin">

Wherefore our bleſſed Sauiour and his Apoſtles vſed often parables and reſemblances taken from earthly things, for the better manifeſting of their heauenly doctrines, and other like arguments alſo, taken out of the booke of nature, well knowne to euery intelligent man, that is found and entire in his outward ſenſes. As when our bleſſed Sauiour appeared to his Diſciples after his reſurrection, and they ſuppoſed that they had ſeene a ſpirit, our Sauiour appealeth to the outward ſenſes, ſaying, handle me and ſee me, for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee me to haue. And when <hi>Thomas</hi> would <note place="margin">Luke 24. 39.</note> not yet beleeue the teſtimony of his fellow Apoſtles, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reſurrection of Chriſt; when he appeared vnto them againe, he ſpake vnto <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaying, put thy finger here and ſee my hands, and ſtretch foorth thy hand and put it into my ſide, and be not faithleſſe but beleeue: The which thing when <note place="margin">Iohn 20. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Thomas</hi> had done, he was ſo conuinced euen by the cenſure of his outward ſenſes, that immediatly he crieth out ſaying, my Lord and my God.</p>
                  <p>So the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to conuince the idolatrous Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians of error for the worſhipping of their gods, with materiall images, alleageth this naturall reaſon, taken out of one of their <note place="margin">Act. 17. 29.</note> owne heatheniſh Poets; ſaying, <hi>Seeing we are the generation of God,</hi> reſembling God by our immortall ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So among the Corinthians, when there was an abuſe <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 14.</note> in ſome of them in wearing long haire, the Apoſtle to redreſſe the ſame, appealeth to the iudgment of nature it ſelfe; ſaying, What, doth not nature it ſelfe teach you, that it is a ſhame for a man to haue long haire? So our bleſſed Sauiour, to perſwade
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1912:39"/> his Diſciples to doe good to their very enemies, ſaith, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth teach the Gentiles themſelues to be good to their friends, and that Chriſtians being aduanced aboue them by <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 45.</note> grace, ſhould learne thereby to doe good to their enemies; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſeeing that ſenſe and experience did plainly teach them, that God maketh his Sunne to riſe on the euill and on the good, and his raine to fall on the iuſt and vniuſt. Wherefore errours may be confuted, and faith and piety perſwaded, not onely by arguments taken out of the booke of grace, but alſo out of the booke of nature. For neither ſenſe nor reaſon, are contrary to religion, or enemies to faith; nay rather right reaſon is a moſt faſt friend to faith, and a moſt valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for true Religion.</p>
                  <p>But yet here this moſt reaſonable caution muſt be added, that when queſtion is of the extraordinary and ſupernaturall workes of God, we take not vpon v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now if againſt theſe things which haue beene deliuered, it be obiected, that faith doth not produce her actions by meanes of diſcourſe, but by the immediate operation and reuelation of the Spirit of God: albeit, this hath beene moſt abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted in all the former part of this Chapter: yet if it were not ſo, this one reaſon is fully ſufficient to conuince the ſame. For where is faith is that to the minde, which the eye is to the body, then it followeth, that as the eye doth not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his obiect immediately, but as it is made conſpicuous by meanes of ſome bodily light: ſo faith which is the ſight of the ſoule, doth not apprehend truth, which is her generall obiect, vnleſſe it be made manifeſt by the light of reaſon, and meanes of diſcourſe. The which is ſo ſure and certaine a truth, that the Apoſtles themſelues who had the knowledge of all diuine and humane verities, neceſſary for ſuch as ſhould be teachers and inſtructers of the whole world; giuen vnto them, not by their owne labours and ſtuddy, but by the immediate reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of God, yet had not this their knowledge without diſcourſe. As it is manifeſt by manner of handling and deciding the queſtion that was brought vnto them; which was, whether the workes of the Law were to be ioyned with faith in Chriſt, in the caſe of iuſtification and ſaluation: For it is recorded, that after the queſtion had beene debated among them with great diſputation and diſcourſe, the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> determined the ſame, and that not without the allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Act. 15. 7.</note> of many arguments and reaſons. As Saint <hi>Iames</hi> cauſed ſome clauſes to be added thereto, but not without the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of iuſt grounds for the ſame. So when the people of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1912:40"/> God were to be carried into captiuitie among the heathen, how did the Lord, fore-ſeeing that they ſhould be intiſed to Idolatry, ſtrengthen them in the Faith and Seruice of the true God, and arme them againſt all contrary perſwaſions, but by deliuering vnto them ſuch reaſons, as whereby they might be fully perſwaded, that their owne God was the onely true God, <note place="margin">Ier. 10. 11.</note> and that the gods of the Heathen were but titularie gods, that <note place="margin">Iſa. 41. 21.</note> is, gods in name, and not in deed.</p>
                  <p>It is a truth confeſſed euen by ſome of the chiefe pillars of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that all the greateſt myſteries of Faith that are neceſſary to ſaluation, are plainely ſet down in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures. Now I would demand whether theſe doctrines there deliuered, are treated and diſcourſed of there verbally, and in bare words onely, or really with ſufficient waight of ſound reaſon? And verily how can any one reaſon without reaſon, and diſcourſe without diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>That there is but one true God, euen the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Prophets <hi>Iſay,</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> proue by moſt ſound and ſufficient arguments in the places cited a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: That this one God is diſtinguiſhed into three perſons, The Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt; why may it not be both iuſtified and illuſtrated and made euident by ſound and ſufficient arguments and reaſons? For whereas God is eſſentially good, yea goodneſſe it ſelfe (ſeeing it is the property of that which is good to communicate it ſelfe to other) why <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bonum eſt ſui communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum.</hi> Pro. 8. 22. Ioh. 5. 26. Ioh 16. 15. Ioh 15. 26.</note> may it not be beleeued as an vndoubted truth, that God the Father gaue his aeternall eſſence to God the Sonne, begotten of him before all worlds? and that God the Father and the Sonne, gaue their aeternall eſſence to God the Holy Ghoſt, proceeding from them both from all aeternity? Hath God giuen to ſome of his mortall creatures, power to beget things of the ſame eſſence and ſubſtance with themſelues? And may not the aeternall God beget an aeternall Sonne of the very ſelfe-ſame eſſence and ſubſtance with himſelfe? And hath God giuen to ſome other of his creatures, as to graine of all ſorts this power, that things of the ſame eſſence and ſubſtance doe proceed from them? And hath not the aeternall Father and the Sonne
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1912:41"/> power, that an aeternall Spirit of the ſame eſſence and ſubſtance ſhould proceed from them both from all aeternity? Is not this world with the creatures therein contained, a moſt liuely glaſſe, wherein the moſt glorious Creator is ſhadowed out vnto vs? And euery good thing that hath a reall and an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute being in the creature, hath it not a reall exiſtence in God? For God is moſt abſolutely and fully perfect; and therefore the perfection of all good things is in God in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of abſolute and full perfection.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſeeing that paternitie, and ſiliation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion are good things in the creature; why may they not rightly be ſaid to be in God, in whom is the fulneſſe of all good things? Of all the creatures of this inferiour world, the ſoule of man is moſt principall, as the Sunne is the chiefeſt of all thoſe goodly lights, that are planted aboue in the heauenly ſpheares: and therefore they are the fitteſt among all the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, in ſome ſort to reſemble vnto vs the glorious Trin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So in the Sunne there is a moſt ſingular pure ſubſtance, and a moſt excellent luſtre and brightneſſe begotten thereof, and reſiding in the ſame, and glorious beames iſſuing from both: So in the moſt glorious Deity wee may behold God the Father, the Father of Light,; God the Sonne the <note place="margin">Iac. 1. 17.</note> brightneſſe of his Fathers glory: God the Holy Ghoſt by whoſe beames the Light of the Goſpell is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <note place="margin">Heb 1 3.</note> vnto vs: and yet this Father of Light, this brightneſſe of his Fathers glory, and this glorious beame iſſuing out of both, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10.</note> is but one and the ſelfe-ſame God.</p>

                     <p>Saving Faith is Diuine wiſedome, or a certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and a ſetled aſſent, and adhaerence to all Diuine verities neceſſary to ſaluation, and eſpecially to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, as to the meanes of our higheſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and our chiefeſt good.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FAith (ſaith the Apoſtle) is the full aſſurance of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note place="margin">Col. 2. 2.</note> and knowledge in the myſterie of God euen the Father, and of Chriſt, which bringeth with it all ſpirituall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and therefore cauſeth the faithfull to eſteeme of it, as of the meanes of their higheſt happineſſe and chiefeſt good.</p>
                  <p>And againe, Faith is ſuch an excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, that maketh the faithfull to eſteeme all other things as dung in reſpect thereof, which giueth them ſuch an aſſurance of their iuſtification &amp; glorification through Chriſt, <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> that the high price thereof is the marke that they aime at in all their indeauours.</p>
                  <p>This pretious Faith (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it) hath two <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> ſingular effects iſſuing out of the ſame, which are, ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began in this life, and an aſſurance of a full glorification in the life to come, The which becauſe they are the certaine ſignes and markes of a true faith; therefore the Apoſtle in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places doth deſcribe it by the ſame. True Faith (ſaith the Apoſtle) is a gift proper to Gods Elect, conſiſting in ſuch <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 1.</note> a knowledge of the truth, which is according to godlineſſe. And that we may know by what diuine truth in particular
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1912:44"/> faith breedeth godlineſſe, the Apoſtle hath ſet it downe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſaying. We all behold as in a mirrour, the glory of the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> Lord with open face, and are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. We all (ſaith he) that are indued with the eye of faith, behold in Chriſt the mirrour and miracle of the Lords matchleſſe mercy, the glory of Gods goodneſſe and loue, he being neuer more glorious then in the ſame; with open face, in reſpect of the reuelation thereof, made in former times vnder obſcure types and ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and by this cleere fight of the Lords moſt glorious loue in Chriſt, we are renewed into his image in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, according as it pleaſeth the Lord to begin the ſame by his Spirit, and to inlarge it alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the other effect of faith, the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth true faith by it alſo, ſaying, faith is the ground of things hoped for, and the euidence of things not ſeene. That is, faith is ſuch a gracious gift, as enableth the faithfull euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to behold the inuiſible things of God, and eſpecially his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable goodneſſe and loue; and giueth them alſo, in him a ſure ground-worke for the aſſurance of their full glorification, which as yet they inioy but in hope. Now in this Chapter we are to intreate of the definition of faith, and of the ſingular ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, in the two next following.</p>
                  <p>Aſſent doth follow apprehenſion, and therefore as a ſlight and a light apprehenſion begetteth opinion, which is an vnſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and an vnſtable aſſent: ſo a ſure and certaine aſſent of the myſteries of godlineſſe ingendereth faith; that is, a reſolute and ſettled perſwaſion. For a ſettled aſſent proceeding from a well grounded knowledge, is all one with ſauing faith, and diuine wiſedome. As it may appeare in that when the Word of God is ſaid either ſeuerally, to giue the knowledge of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lords people, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 77. or to giue faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. or to giue wiſedome vnto the ſimple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. or ioyntly to bring to the vnity of faith, and of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Sonne of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Iob.</hi> 6. 60. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 16. or to bring the vnderſtanding of wiſedome and knowledge, <hi>Prou.</hi> 1. 2. 9. 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Iac.</hi> 3. 13. or to

                  <p>The minde and the vnderſtanding is the eye of the ſoule, and a ſure and ſettled knowledge of the myſteries of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſauing fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And hereof it is, that our bleſſed Sauiour not onely in his owne perſon calling men to repent and to beleeue the Goſpell, is ſaid to preach recouering of ſight to the blinde; <note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> But alſo ſending out his Apoſtles to goe into the whole world and to preach the Goſpell to euery creature, is ſaid to ſend them out to open their eyes, that they might turne from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they <note place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note> might receiue remiſſion of ſinnes, and inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith in him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the opening of the eyes of the faithfull where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they truly apprehend the myſteries of godlineſſe, is called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion,</hi> as the Spirit of God which worketh this viſion is called <note place="margin">Prou. 19. 18. Iohn 2. 20. 1 Sam. 9. 9.</note> an eye ſalue, and as the Reuealers of this doctrine in old time were called <hi>Seers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And verily the true fight, apprehenſion, and knowledge of the Couenant of grace, and of all other diuine doctrines of the word of God, is (as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith) a ſpeciall gift of God, proper to ſuch onely as are predeſtinated to this, euen to walke <note place="margin">Orig. lib. 7. cont.

And ſo was Faith defined by the ancient Fathers, both Greeke and Latine, as Doctor <hi>Benfield</hi> teſtifieth in his third Chapter concerning ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Faith.</p>
                  <p>The Deuils and all obſtinate and impenitent ſinners, as they haue neither ſauing Faith, nor diuine wiſedome; ſo neither haue they any ſuch ſight, apprehenſion and knowledge of the diuine verities of Gods moſt holy Word, as cauſeth them to yeeld a ſure and certaine aſſent thereunto. The Deuils in their creation were Angels of light, and were ſanctified with the cleere knowledge of all diuine verities, but now they haue loſt <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 17. <hi>Chryſ. hom. 19. in Pſal.</hi> 118.</note> ſanctity by falling away from God the Father thereof, and from truth the mother and nurſe of the ſame. The Deuill (ſaith our Sauiour) abode not in truth, but is a liar and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies; he made choice to miſconceiue of God, that he <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 44.</note> was vniuſt, hard, and cruell, and he is ſo blinded and hardened therein, that he cannot, nor will not be remooued from the ſame. As it may appeare in that he refuſed to ſtand to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Sauiour Chriſt, laying euer to his charge iniuſtice, and cruelty: ſaying, What haue we to do with thee thou Ieſus of Nazareth? Art thou come to torment vs before the <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 29.</note> time?</p>
                  <p>And verily, from that which preſerued at the firſt, and ſtill preſerueth the elect Angels, (as <hi>Iſidore</hi> teſtifieth) that is, from the viſion, and contemplation, and ſettled perſwaſion of all thoſe diuine perfections that be in God, eſpecially of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and endleſſe goodneſſe and loue: the reprobate Angels fell, and wholly depriued themſelues thereof, and therefore doe not now know and acknowledge, that God is righteous, gracious, and good, nor honour him by aſcribing vnto him theſe glorious perfections.</p>
                  <p>Now as the old Serpent hath thus inuenomed himſelfe, ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1912:46"/> hath he with the ſame poiſon infected the nature of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> &amp; of al vs which by ordinary generation deſcend from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For he perſwaded our firſt parents, not only that God was not good vnto them, for that he forbad them the vſe of the fruit of one of the trees of Paradiſe, and withheld from them the knowledge of good and euill, leſt thereby they ſhould become as Gods; but alſo that he was not righteous and true, and that the euils wherewith he threatned them, if they brake his Commandement, ſhould not come vpon them.</p>
                  <p>By which miſſe perſwaſion, they miſconceiuing of Gods goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe, were hardened with all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity in this miſconceit. In ſo much, that now by nature there is none that vnderſtandeth and ſeeketh after God, there <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 10.</note> is none that beleeueth his goodnes, and imbraceth the meanes whereby they may be made partakers thereof, nor feareth his iuſtice, and ceaſeth to ſtirre vp his indignation and wrath. They beleeue not Gods goodneſſe, but ſcorne the faithfull (as the wiſe man teſtifieth) that doe the ſame, thinking it to be a thing impoſſible that any can haue the aſſurance of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue. They beleeue not Gods iuſtice, for then they <note place="margin">Sap. 2. 13.</note> would auoid ſinne, if it were but to eſcape the dreadfull execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods vengeance due to the ſame. Our conſcience (ſaith Saint <hi>Cyprian)</hi> would be afraid if it did beleeue, but becauſe it <note place="margin">Cypr. de ſimpl.

                  <p>The perſons indued with a temporary faith, draw neareſt to ſuch as haue obtained a true, ſauing, and iuſtifying faith; For they come gladly vnto the holy aſſemblies, and heare the word willingly, and incontinently with ioy receiue the ſame, but this they doe vpon ſome ſiniſter reſpect, as for curioſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or for vaine-glory, or for profit and preferment: and while they obtaine thereby their deſires, they will ſeeme to be zealous and ſeruent profeſſors; but when they are croſſed in their purpoſes, then their zeale draweth cold, and the heat
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1912:46"/> thereof is vtterly extinguiſhed: whereas they that are endued <note place="margin">Luke 8. 13.</note> with a true faith, receiue the word with a ſimple, honeſt, and good heart, and in all ſincerity imbrace the Goſpel for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels ſake, euen becauſe it openeth the way to true happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>The Temporiſers happineſſe, whatſoeuer outward profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he maketh to the contrary, is to enioy earthly things, and therefore he will forſake faith and a good conſcience, and God alſo rather then he, will forſake them, but ſuch as be faithfull men indeed, will not leaue the grant of Gods endleſſe loue in Chriſt, made ouer to them in the Goſpell, no not to gaine a vaſt world of glorie, or to eſcape a whole hell of miſerie. And this commeth to paſſe for that the word of God is of the one, but ſuperficially receiued, and therefore at the laſt withereth and dieth; Whereas in the other it taketh deepe roote, and therefore liueth and flouriſheth in them continually; In the one it poſſeſſeth as it were the vnfenſed ſuburbes of their ſenſes, and the weake ſconſes of their phantaſies; but in the other it ſeateth it ſelfe in the well-defenced Cities of their ſoules, and in the vnconquerable Caſtle of a good conſcience.

The plaine and euident revelation and manifeſtation thereof in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, openeth the eyes of a blinded ſinner, and giueth to him the ſight of a true Chriſtian ſauing ſaith, whereby he turneth from darkeneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan, to God, and <note place="margin">Acts 26. 18. 2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> worketh in him a reuerent feare to offend the Lord, and a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing care to performe all duties that doe belong to piety and godlineſſe.

                  <p>As if the minde reſolue, that our chiefeſt happines conſiſteth in the plentifull poſſeſſion and fruition of all earthly profits and pleaſures, then will the will and affections be wholly ſet vpon earthly things; but if it reſolue that our higheſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and our chiefeſt good conſiſteth in our communion with God, and in the cleere manifeſtation of his loue in Chriſt, then will our hearts be lifted vp to God, and fixed on Chriſt, and ſettled vpon heauen and heauenly things.

Doth infidelity withdraw mens hearts from God, and corrupt their wils and affections? and doth not faith ioyne men neerely vnto God, and ſanctifie their wils and affections with all manner of diuine and heauenly graces?</p>
                  <p>Wherefore as all carnall Goſpellers and looſe Libertines, ſo our Romane Catholikes are greatly deceiued, in that they thinke that a ſauing and iuſtifying faith may ſtand with raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſinnes; for then ſhould the ſelfe-ſame perſons at the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame time be the children of God in reſpect of their mindes, ſanctified with the knowledge of the truth, and with ſauing faith; and the children of the Deuill in their wils being pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with dominering ſins, but where ſauing faith getteth the ſure and ſafe poſſeſſion of the minde, it not only expelleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity out of the caſtle of the vnderſtanding, but alſo caſteth out all ſinne and iniquity out of the forts of the will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that they ſhall no longer rule and raigne there. For ſauing faith doth regenerate vs and make vs the ſons of God, <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 26.</note> as the Apoſtle affirmeth, and ſo reneweth vs to his image in holineſſe and crue righteouſneſſe; and therefore will not ſuffer
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1912:51"/> vs to giue place to wilfull and raigning ſinnes, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous tranſgreſſions: Whoſoeuer (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn)</hi> is borne <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 9.</note> of God ſinneth not, for his ſeed remaineth in him, neither can he ſinne, becauſe he is borne of God: that is, whoſoeuer is borne of God, committeth no ſuch ſinnes whereby the Word of God is choaked and extinguiſhed in him, becauſe it is an immortall ſeed which liueth and indureth for euer where it is <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23.</note> once rooted and ſettled; neither can hee ſinne becauſe hee is borne of God: That is, ſinne, which is the worke of the Deuill, cannot ſo farre forth preuaile, as to annihilate his regeneration which is the worke of God, becauſe God is ſtronger then the Deuill, and will maintaine his owne proper worke in his owne children, againſt the malice and miſchiefe of Satan.</p>
                  <p>For let the Deuill ſet his chiefeſt inſtruments on worke to draw Gods children from their faith and obedience to God, yet they ſhall not finally preuaile againſt them. So Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> Little children ye are of God, and haue ouercome them; for <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 4.</note> greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1912:51"/> made the ſonnes of God, and inheritours of the kingdome of heauen: How can we giue ouer our ſelues to wilfull and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinnes, to the great diſhonour of our louing and moſt gracious God, who hath aduanced vs to ſo great digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honor? Vndoubtedly they cannot but thus reſolue with themſelues, their ſure beleefe of ſo great a fauour, throughly ſettled in their hearts, will not ſuffer them to giue themſelues ouer to the ſeruice of ſinne, but will cauſe them fully to reſolue to continue and perſeuere in conſtant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall obedience vnto God.</p>
                  <p>And in this reſpect, the eſtate of all ſuch as are reconciled vnto God by Chriſt, albeit it be ſubiect to many infirmities, is farre more happy then <hi>Adams</hi> was in his abſolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect purity. For (as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith) the firſt liberty was a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug. de corrept. &amp; grat. cap.</hi> 2.</note> poſſibility not to ſinne, but ours is much greater, being ſuch as that we cannot poſſibly ſinne; that is, giue our ſelues ouer to be bondſlaues to raigning ſinnes. For to <hi>Adam</hi> was giuen grace to perſiſt in grace if he would, but to vs it is giuen, that we be made willing, and that by our will we conquer our concupiſcence: to him was giuen ability, if he himſelfe would haue vſed it, but to vs is giuen not only to be able, but alſo to be willing to vſe our ability. For the will of the Saints is ſo forcibly mooued by the Spirit of God, that therefore they are able, becauſe they will; and therefore they will, becauſe it is God that worketh in them that they be willing.</p>
                  <p>For if in ſo great infirmity, wherein perfect vertue was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the ſuppreſſing of pride, they were left to their owne will, that by the helpe of God they might perſiſt if they would themſelues, and that God himſelfe did not worke in them the very will that they would: among ſo many and ſo great tentations, the will by reaſon of her weakneſſe would ſoone relent and giue ouer. A remedy therefore was prouided for the infirmity of mans will, that it ſhould be ſo mooued by diuine grace, that it ſhould neuer decline or ſeparate it ſelfe from the ſame: and therefore albeit it were weake, yet it ſhould neuer vtterly faile.</p>
                  <p>Now that Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> did not miſtake herein, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1912:52"/> by the teſtimony of God himſelfe, ſet downe by the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> in moſt direct words to that purpoſe; I will <note place="margin">Ier. 32. 40.</note> (ſaith the Lord) make an euerlaſting Couenant with them, (meaning his faithfull ones vnder the time of grace) that I will not turne away from them to doe them good, but I will put my feare in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me. So then now vnder the Couenant of grace, diuine grace is not ſo offered to the faithfull, that they may either chuſe or refuſe it if they will, but thereby they are made both willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it at the firſt, and reſolute alſo to perſeuere therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, euen to the end: and therefore by the Spirit of God, they are called trees which ſhall not ceaſe from yeelding fruit. <note place="margin">Ier. 17. 8.</note> Whereby it is manifeſt, that grace lightning the vnderſtanding with a true faith, doth ſanctifie the will with all other vertues, and eſtabliſh it alſo with conſtancy and perſeuerance.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore a well-grounded knowledge of the myſteries of godlineſſe, diuine wiſdome, and ſauing faith doe neuer goe alone, but take their traine with them, and are alwaies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all other diuine and heauenly vertues.

                  <p>THat which all erronious profeſſions doe promiſe, that the Goſpell of Chriſt doth performe, euen a ſure faith, and a faithfull aſſurance of the fauour and loue of God, and of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1912:52"/> eternall happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe. For herein is reuealed the Couenant of grace, grounded vpon a ſtrong foundation, euen vpon him that is <hi>Immanuell,</hi> God with vs, a moſt powerfull Reconciler of men vnto God, and a moſt gracious procurer of Gods fauour and loue. For mans ſinne being committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the infinite maieſty of the moſt glorious Deity, could not be done away but by an infinite ſatisfaction; and Gods loue and euerlaſting happineſſe conſiſting therein, being bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of an inualuable worth, could not haue beene purchaſed, but by an inualuable price. Now this infinite ſatisfaction, and inualuable price could not haue beene tendred but by ſuch an one that was true man ioyned in one perſon to the true God, that ſo he might be a meet Mediatour betweene God and man.</p>
                  <p>And ſo he himſelfe teſtifieth, ſaying, I am the way, the truth, <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 6.</note> and the life, no man commeth vnto the Father but by me: It is then by Chriſts meanes that wee beleeue in God, and haue an aſſurance of his fauour and loue. For to him God gaue after his ſhamefull death, which he ſuffered for our ſins, a glorious reſurrection; as an ample teſtification of his full ſatisfaction made for them all, and of his victorious conqueſt ouer death, that ſo we might haue faith and hope in God. Wherefore if <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 21.</note> God hath plainly opened vnto vs the worke of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reconciliation wrought by Chriſt, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Couenant of grace, wherein God offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a gracious God, and a louing Father to all ſuch as imbrace it with a true faith; it cannot be, but if that with a true faith we apprehend this gracious Couenant, we ſhould reſt thereby throughly perſwaded of the Lords ineſtimable fauour and loue towards vs.</p>
                  <p>Now that the vndoubted truth therof may euidently appeare, let vs obſerue theſe three circumſtances: Firſt, the time when this aſſurance is giuen: Secondly, the meanes whereby it is wrought: Thirdly, the witneſſes that giue euidence to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and infallibility thereof. Now concerning the firſt, when God by the light of the Goſpel doth open our eies, &amp; make vs to behold the light of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance ſhining vnto vs in Chriſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1912:53"/> Ieſus, and thereby doth not only informe our vnderſtanding, but alſo reforme our will and affections, euen then in ſome meaſure he giueth vnto vs this comfortable aſſurance, that he hath admitted vs among the number of his children, and hath matriculated vs into the Vniuerſity of his Saints, and hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred our names into his booke of life.</p>
                  <p>For that which our bleſſed Sauiour auouched of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when he willingly receiued by loue Chriſts perſon into his houſe, and his doctrine by faith into his heart: This day is ſaluation come to this houſe, for as much as this man is become <note place="margin">Luke 19. 9.</note> the ſonne of Abraham; that is to be auerred of all perſons whatſoeuer, that readily imbrace the faith that was in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> ſeeing all ſuch as haue their hearts purged by faith, are <note place="margin">Rom. 4 12.

Of the certainty and euidency of the truth thereof, the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo confident, that he appealeth to euery faithfull mans experience among the Romans concerning the ſame; ſaying, Know ye not that to <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> whomſoeuer ye giue your ſelues as ſeruants to obey, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ye are, to whom ye obey, whether it be of ſinne vnto death, or of obedience vnto righteouſneſſe? The faithfull then being well witting to their own hearts that they haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen themſelues to God, and are carefull to performe the works of faith, loue, holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe according vnto the rule of Gods word, in obedience vnto God, doe ſo throughly know hereby that they do an acceptable ſeruice vnto God, and that they are his obedient ſeruants, that they doe greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce therein with the Apoſtle; This is our reioycing, euen the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly pureneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be obiected that the faithfull know not their owne hearts, nor the true nature of theſe diuine graces, nor the right notes and markes of the holy workes that proceed from them, and therefore albeit they are indued with theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and performe theſe works, yet they cannot know that they are the ſeruants of God; We anſwer, firſt, that that obiection is in direct tearmes, flat contrary to the teſtimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet before alleaged, where the faithfull being commanded to do their works according to the rule of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being from their hearts made carefull thereof, are thereby aſſured that they are the obedient ſeruants of the Lord. Secondly, we anſwere, that all men doe in part know their owne hearts, and their thoughts, words, and workes, and that the faithfull doe in ſome meaſure know the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all heauenly graces, and the right notes of their true fruits.</p>
                  <p>All men doe know themſelues in part, becauſe God hath giuen to all a conſcience to be a witneſſe together with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, not onely of their words and workes, but alſo of the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note> very thoughts and purpoſes of their hearts, as the names of

Iohn 6. 45. Act. 2. 17.</note> and to vnderſtand what belongeth to a ſound faith, and to an holy and godly life. For the faithfull know that ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and knowledge of Chriſt, as cauſeth all things to be as dung to them in reſpect thereof, is a ſure ſigne of a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied minde, lightened with the cleare ſight of a true faith. They know that to deſire to inioy the loue of God aboue all other things whatſoeuer, and to be willing and ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with God and with Chriſt in the daily and religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the word of God, and prayer, and to loue the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren becauſe they loue God, and are beloued of God, are true tokens of true Chriſtian loue.</p>
                  <p>They know alſo, that to be truly ſorrowfull for offending ſo louing and gracious a God, as he hath declared himſelfe to be in Chriſt, and in that reſpect to feare to offend him, and to be carefull to walke in all his righteous Lawes, are ſure ſignes of true repentance, and of the right feare of God, and of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. And they knowing in their owne conſciences that they haue by the gracious worke of the Spirit of God, ſuch a faith, loue, repentance, feare, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, know that they are in Gods fauour and loue, and that they are his faithfull ſeruants: We know (ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſpeaking in the name of all the faithfull) that we are of God, <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 29.</note> and that the whole world lieth in wickedneſſe; We know

And againe, we know that we are tranſlated from death <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 14.</note> to life, becauſe we loue the brethren. And that he ſpeaketh thus in the name of all the faithfull, we may vnderſtand in that in the like aſſeueration, he changeth the perſon; ſaying, If ye know that God is righteous, know ye that he that doth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is borne of God, by the which teſtimonies of the <note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 29.</note> Apoſtle it is manifeſt, that the faithfull knowing that they are indued with the true knowledge of Chriſt, and with true loue, and with true righteouſneſſe, know thereby that they are of God, and that they are his elect and choſen children.</p>
                  <p>For as a true friend among men, doth beſtow ſuch fauours and gifts vpon him whom he intirely and tenderly loueth, as the receiuer vnderſtandeth what they are and their worth alſo, that ſo by manifeſting his great kindneſſe he may winne mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and reciprocall loue: ſo God the friend of friends, giueth his ſpirituall graces vnto all thoſe whom he hath loued in Chriſt, and choſen in him before the foundation of the world, and maketh them to vnderſtand what theſe his principall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are, and the end why he giueth them, euen to aſſure them of his fatherly fauour and loue. Yea, he maketh them ſenſible of this gracious worke of his Spirit in their owne hearts, when he effecteth the ſame by the powerfull operation of his owne holy Spirit, and worketh a true ſenſe and feeling thereof in the receiuers themſelues, as it hath already beene declared in the opening of the ſecond queſtion of the firſt part of this treatiſe, and ſhall bee further cleared alſo in the ſecond part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For that the faithfull ſhould not doubt of Gods loue toward themſelues, he giueth his owne ſanctifying Spirit, and their owne ſanctified ſpirits to teſtifie the ſame, that againſt the ſufficiency of their teſtimonies, no man can take any iuſt <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> exception.</p>
                  <p>In the Law (ſaith our Sauiour) it is written that the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 17.</note> of two men is true. Of what an vndoubted truth then is that thing, which is witneſſed by a ſanctified conſcience

Now if the witneſſe of a ſanctified conſcience be of ſuch validity, which yet is but an humane teſtimony, what is the witneſſe of God himſelfe? Now this is the witneſſe of God (ſaith the Apoſtle) that not <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 9.</note> onely he hath giuen vnto vs eternall life, but alſo that he hath by his Spirit giuen vnto vs our faich to teſtifie the ſame to our owne ſoules, and that to this end, that we might know that we haue eternall life, and that we might beleeue <hi>(viz.</hi> by a faith daily growing ſtronger and ſtronger) in the name of the Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>The which thing cannot be but effectually wrought, if the faithfull would daily and duly conſider, that the promiſe of bleſſedneſſe made by Chriſt to all that beleeue, was by God deliuered not onely by word of mouth, but alſo by an oath, <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 24.</note> and after the ſame maner was redeliuered to Chriſt, and that to this end, that by two immutable things, wherein it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17.</note> that God ſhould lie, we might haue ſtrong conſolation; and not only ſo, but alſo was ſet downe vnder his own hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe in all the bookes of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and further yet, was ratified and confirmed by many feales of diuers Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore no maruell though the faithfull in former ages haue often openly made profeſſion of this their comfortable aſſurance of Gods loue, publiſhing and proclaiming, that God was their God and they his ſeruants, and that Chriſt was their Chriſt in particular, and that by his Bloud, ſhed preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for themſelues, they were iuſtified from all their ſinnes.

                  <p>There be two things that hinder this comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in all the faithfull more or leſſe, eſpecially in the time of ſome grieuous tentation.

And ſecondly, the remnants of diſtruſtfull feare of vtterly falling away from God, cauſed by their manifold and daily fals; but the ſmall meaſure of faith, and of other graces of ſanctification, ought not to hinder the aſſurance of the faithfull; becauſe a little faith is a true faith, aſwell as a great faith; ſeeing more or leſſe doth not change <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, when the Lord doth promiſe that he will be a gracious God to all that beleeue, repent, and returne vnto him, loue him, and feare him, and walke in his waies, he doth not reſpect the perfection of theſe graces, nor the worth of the workes that proceed from them, but theſe promiſes are all founded vpon the worthineſſe of Chriſt, who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">Act. 3. 26.

The ſmall meaſure then of faith, and of all other graces of ſanctification, ought not to diſcourage the faithfull, nor yet their ſins of ignorance and infirmitie; ſeeing the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">Leuit. 4 2.

And albeit ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the faithfull as long as they liue, yet if godly ſorrow woundeth it, a godly death ſhall vtterly deſtroy it: And if in any one, ſinne be deadly wounded, and at the laſt vtterly deſtroyed, how can it worke ſuch a perſons deſtruction?</p>
                  <p>Now albeit the faithfull many times fall, yet they neuer vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fall away, ſeeing the <hi>Lord ordereth a good mans going, and</hi>

                  <p>Now whether this aſſurance be the forme or the effect of a true faith, we need not to be too peremptory herein; vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly the Apoſtle ſeemeth to ſet it downe as an effect of faith; <hi>By Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we haue boldneſſe and entrance, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>

But that truſt and confidence whereby a faithfull man is perſwaded, that God is to him in particular a gracious God, and a louing Father in Chriſt, ariſing vpon the action of the ſoule refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vpon it ſelfe, and vpon it's owne ſpirituall eſtate, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of all the Diuine graces of the Spirit, wherewithall it is endued, is not faith, but an effect thereof, euen an habit, or rather an act of a ſanctified conſcience, lightned with a true faith; as our moſt Reuerend <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> now a Citizen with the Saints in Heauen hath auouched in the ſecond part of his Defence againſt D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, <hi>Biſhop fol.</hi> 269. and Reuerend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkins,</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> The ſumme of whoſe doctrine is comprehended in this Syllogiſme.</p>
                  <p>If whoſoeuer beleeueth, repenteth, loueth, and feareth God,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1912:59"/> and hath a ſincere care to walke in all his commandements, is moſt aſſuredly in Gods loue, and ſhall vndoubtedly be ſaued, then whoſoeuer knoweth aſſuredly that he beleeueth, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, loueth, and feareth God, and hath a ſincere care to walke in all his Commandements, knoweth aſſuredly thereby that he is in Gods loue, and that vndoubtedly he ſhall be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>But I know (ſaith euery ſincere and faithfull Chriſtian) by the act of mine owne conſcience reflected vpon my ſelfe, that I beleeue, repent, loue, and feare God, and haue a ſincere care to walke in all his Commandements.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I know aſſuredly that I am in Gods loue, and ſhall vndoubtedly be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Now to giue a ſure and a certaine aſſent to the maior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition grounded vpon the vndoubted truth of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, made to all the faithfull in Chriſt Ieſus, and to be confident of the infallibilitie thereof, is of the very eſſence &amp; ſubſtance of faith; but to aſſume the minor propoſition, and thereupon to inferre the concluſion, is an act of a ſanctified conſcience, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a true faith.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> commendeth doubtfulneſſe of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a propertie beſeeming Chriſtian humilitie and feare, and condemneth the infallible aſſurance thereof of haereticall ſecurity and preſumption.

That ſo we may know that ſhe is <hi>Babel</hi> the Mother of confuſion, for that ſhe doth by the contrariety of her actions and poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ouer-throw her owne principall grounds.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicke muſt liue in feare and ſuſpence of the full pardon of his ſinnes by faith in Chriſts bloud, and yet if he receiue abſolution from a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, or a Pardon from the Pope, he muſt reſt aſſured thereof: A <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicke muſt not reſt aſſured of his iuſtification and ſaluation by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, imputed vnto him by the free and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerued grace and mercy of God, but if he be carefull to fulfill the Law of God and the rules of their religious orders, hee

Nay, by murthering of Princes &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing of ſtates euen againſt their oathes &amp; alleagiance, they may not onely merit heauen, but deſerue happily (if it ſo pleaſe the Pope) the dignity thereof, a Canonized Saint.</p>
                  <p>But to erect ſo great a building as is the aſſurance of our iuſtification and ſaluation vpon ſo weake and rotten foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is in truth preſumptuous and intollerable folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For if we would reſpect, I ſay not the workes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, wrought wholly, or in part by our owne free-will, but the principall fruits of the Spirit of God, and the beſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that the faithfull are enabled to performe thereby, are not theſe Gods ſpeciall gifts, making vs indebted vnto God, and therefore deſeruing nothing, much leſſe iuſtification and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Gods hands? but if we would conſider them as pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and pawnes of Gods loue, procured for vs by Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and as the firſt fruites of that heauenly inheritance, which he himſelfe hath purchaſed for vs, how can we but reſt aſſured to be brought in the time appointed by the Lord, to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that, whereof we haue ſo certaine an earneſt, and ſo ſure a pledge.</p>
                  <p>In paſting ouer temporall Land from man to man, we eſteeme much of good ſecuritie, which highly commendeth euen an hard bargaine: A ſound title, and a good conueyance, from ſuch and ſuch perſons, to ſuch and ſuch other, maketh the ſecurity to be ſufficient. The goodlieſt poſſeſſion that can be paſſed ouer to any of the ſonnes of men, is the glorious manner of the coeleſtiall Paradiſe, the true title thereunto is Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, the conueyance thereof, is the Word and the Sacraments, which giue Chriſt to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and the ſure and certaine earneſt of the ſame, is the firſt fruits of the Spirit. But to our <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholickes, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of our bleſſed Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, performed for vs in his owne perſon, and imputed vnto vs by the Lords moſt free and vndeſerued mercy, is a meere nullity, and new no iuſtice, and the apprehenſion thereof by faith, is a phantaſticall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1912:60"/> apprehenſion of that which is not a falſe faith, and an vntrue imputation, as our maſters of <hi>Rhemes</hi> haue taught. For their <note place="margin">Rhem. in c. 3. ad Rom.</note> title to the heauenly Paradiſe, is the merit of that righteouſnes which is wrought by themſelues, and their conueyances are the Popes Indulgences and Pardons, and their Prieſts Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and Maſſes, and the deuotions of the men of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders. But what is their ſecuritie for all this? verily nono at all; for they are commanded to liue ſtill in feare and doubtfulneſſe, becauſe they know not how much they faile in the meaſure, and manner of the fulfilling of this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and whether or no they ſhall be enabled to perſeuere. And verily no maruaile that their ſecurity for their heauenly happineſſe is ſo ſmall, or none at all, ſeeing their pay for the ſame is in ſuch light and clipt money, yea in ſuch baſe and counterfeit coyne, and their conueyance thereof ſo feeble and weake.</p>
                  <p>The faith of our <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicks, as they themſelues teach, is ſuch a faith as may be in the deuils, and therefore no maruaile but as the <hi>deuils beleeue and tremble,</hi> ſo they doe beleeue and <note place="margin">Iac. 2. 19.</note> tremble alſo: but wheras the pay made for the purchaſe of the coeleſtiall Paradiſe vnto all faithfull Chriſtians, is the abſolute and perfect rigteouſneſſe of Chriſt performed for them, and the conueyauce thereof vnto them, is the Lords gracious grant thereof ſet downe in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and ſealed with the ſeales of the holy Sacraments, both of the Old and New Teſtament, therefore the true faithfull Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an needeth not to feare and to doubt of his ſaluation, ſeeing he hath ſo good euidence for the ſame. For ſeeing Chriſt hath deliuered them out of the hands of their enemies, that they ſhould ſerue the Lord without feare, in holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe <note place="margin">Luke 1. 74.</note> all the dayes of their liues; why ſhould they feare, or doubt to enioy the fruit of this deliuerance wrought by ſuch a perſon, and by ſuch meanes.</p>
                  <p>Aſſuredly they doe not as the Apoſtle teſtifieth, ſpeaking in the name of all the faithfull; Yee (ſaith he) haue not receiued <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> the ſpirit of bondage to feare againe, but yee haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption, where by we cry <hi>Abba,</hi> Father, the ſame

                  <p>When <hi>Eſayas</hi> more like an Euangeliſt then a Prophet, had publiſhed this doctrine of faith, euen to the Lords own people, what was his owne teſtimony concerning his ſucceſſe thereof, <note place="margin">Eſay 53. 1.</note> but this? Lord who hath beleeued our report, &amp; to whomis the arme of the Lord renealed? Nay, when our bleſſed Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf came in his own perſon to preach theſe glad ridings of the Goſpell, euen with the mouth &amp; tongue of the Son of God, &amp; after ſo wiſe and powerfull a manner, that his very enemies did wonder at the gracious words that came out of his mouth; and were forced to confeſſe, That neuer man ſpake as he did.

                  <p>And yet behold a thing more to be maruelled at, that the Apoſtles themſelues who continually heard our Sauiours di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and heauenly doctrine, and daily ſaw his wonderfull workes, were yet ſo hardly brought to the faith, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour after his reſurrection forced to reprooue them moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly for it; ſaying, Oh ye fooles, and ſlow of heart to beleeue all that the Prophets haue ſpoken.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1912:64"/> taught by the Preacher, and commanded by the Prince; yet a ſettled perſwaſion proceeding from a ſure and ſound appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, is vndoubtedly a ſtrange and wonderfull worke of God. Without all controuerſie (ſaith the Apoſtle) great is <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> this myſtery of godlineſſe, God manifeſted in the fleſh, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Spirit, ſeene of Angels, preached vnto the Gentiles, and beleeued on in the world; yea, the agreement of faith, with the heart of man, is eſteemed by Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> to be one of the greateſt miracles of our Chriſtian profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>And verily, if either we looke vpon the prophane world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, we ſhall ſee them ſcorning at the aſſurance of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <note place="margin">Sap. 2. 13.</note> which cauſeth them to glory that God is their Father, and hath adopted them for his Sonnes: Or if we caſt our eyes vpon the faithfull ſeruant of God himſelfe, when he is in any great ſpirituall conflict, we ſhall ſoone ſee how ready he is to let looſe the ſure hold of his hope, and to plunge himſelfe into the gulfe of deſpaire, becauſe he is guiltie to himſelfe of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo good and ſo gracious a God, by his owne manifold and great iniquities and ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, albeit we haue attained to ſuch a meaſure of faith as was giuen by Chriſt to his owne Apoſtles, yet had <note place="margin">Luke 17. 5.

This is the commandement of God, <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 23.</note> that ye beleeue in the name of the Sonne of God, and loue one another as he gaue commandement. Wherefore the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the carnall profeſſour, and of the Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, made againſt the doctrine of the Goſpell, is vniuſt and vntrue: which is, that an eaſie way is laid open by the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours

                  </argument>
                  <p>Knowne vnto God are all his workes from the beginning <note place="margin">Act. 15. 18. 1 Cor. 2. 11.</note> of the world, and to none other beſides himſelfe; and therefore he onely is able to reueale them. Wherefore ſeeing the works of the creation, redemption, and Sanctification, which are the moſt gracious and glorious workes of God, are plainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in the bookes of the Holy Scriptures; therefore the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the holy bookes are faithfully to be embraced, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly proceeding from diuine reuelation. And verily who could ſo diſtinctly and particularly ſet downe the manner of the creation of man, and of all the reſt of the creatures, but he that hauing the fulneſſe of being in himſelfe, could giue ſuch a manner and meaſure of being to them all, as ſhould manifeſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1912:76"/> his great power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe towards man, for whoſe ſake principally the world was made.</p>
                  <p>And who could lay open the fall of man, from his eſtate of holineſſe and happineſſe, wherein he was created, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof, but he onely, from whoſe obedience albeit man could depart, yet he could not depart from his preſence, nor ſo much as dazle his ſharpe and cleare eyes, albeit he could cleane put out his owne? but who could open a meanes of mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery from this his miſerable and wretched eſtate, whereinto he is fallen by his owne folly, but he that was onely able to worke his recouery? It is euident that ſinne being an offence committed againſt the infinite Maieſty of the moſt glorious Deity, requireth a ſatisfaction no leſſe then infinite. Now who could ſo much as imagine that God being ſo grieuouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, and ſo highly offended with man, ſhould ſend his owne Sonne to become man, that in mans nature he might ſuffer death for mans deliuery from death and condemnation? For doubtleſſe one will ſcarce die for a righteous man, for a good <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 7.</note> man it may be that one dare dye; that then ſuch a perſon, who when he was in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God, ſhould die for ſuch perſons, as were not onely neither righteous nor good, but aboue meaſure vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and euill: and that he ſhould die ſuch a death as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the intollerable wrath of ſo highly incenſed a God, againſt moſt execrable and curſed ſinnes, <hi>Who hath beleeued our report? and to whom is the arme of the Lord reuealed?</hi>

                  <p>Surely the Goſpell wherein this worke is reuealed, is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and ſupernaturall, exceeding all humane and naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and could not be reuealed but by him, that could worke beyond the power of nature. The which thing doth more euidently appeare hereby, in that whereſoeuer it is plainely reuealed, and ſincerely imbraced, it doth deliuer all ſuch from the moſt grieuous bondage of ſinne and Satan, and doth moſt effectually bring them backe againe vnto God. For (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith) Let humane wiſedome ſtretch it ſelfe to the vttermoſt, yet it can but cauſe men to couer their ſinnes, it cannot enable them to caſt them out, whereas the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1912:77"/> Goſpell, which is the Law of the Spirit of Life, not onely freed Saint <hi>Paul</hi> from the Law of ſinne and death, but alſo conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> the world, and that in ſhort time from infidelity to faith, from ſinne to righteouſneſſe, from Satan to God; albeit it was moſt mightily reſiſted, not onely with all the wiſedome and learning, but alſo with all the power and authority of all the wiſeſt and greateſt men of the world: and therefore it cannot be denyed, but that it is the moſt mighty and powerfull word of the moſt mighty and powerfull God. The heauens declare themſelues to be the workes of God, in that they cauſe the earth which is ſo bare and barren at Winter, to be cloathed in Summer with all manner of hearbes, flowers, and graine, and to abound with all variety of fruit; and doth not the doctrine of the holy Scriptures much more euidently declare it ſelfe to be the moſt powerfull word of the moſt powerfull God, in that it beautifieth the bare and barren ſoile of our ſoules, with true wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, and with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpirituall graces?</p>
                  <p>It was an euident effect of the diuine power of the mighty word of the omnipotent God, that thereby in the Creation all things receiued their eſſence and being, but of an euill man to make a good man, yea, to make one that is bruitiſh and diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, to become reaſonable and Angelicall, is a farre greater worke then the Creation of the whole heauen and earth (as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> teacheth.)

                  <p>Wherefore no maruell that the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 1.</note> the truth of his Apoſtleſhip, and Apoſtolicall doctrine was queſtioned by ſome among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſo confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth that he ſtandeth not in need of any teſtimoniall from men for his approbation and iuſtification, ſeeing their owne conuerſion wrought by that word which was written in their hearts by his Miniſtery, was a moſt ſufficient demonſtration that his Apoſtleſhip and doctrine was from God. The great works wrought here by our bleſſed Sauiour, in the time of his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1912:77"/> being on earth, did ſufficiently declare him to be the true <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 5. Ioh. 5. 36.</note> Meſſiah; and ſhall not the greater workes wrought by his word, ſince his departure out of this life, plainely demonſtrate it to be the very word of the Sonne of God himſelfe?</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if the blind Papiſts, the moſt ſightfull and ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies of the ſincere Profeſſors of the Goſpell of Chriſt, ſhal ſtill auouch that they cannot know that the doctrine of the Scriptures is the doctrine of God, but by the teſtimony of the Church, we anſwer them as the man cured of his blindneſſe by our moſt bleſſed Sauiour, anſwered the blind Phariſies, when they made proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they knew not whence our Sauiour was, <hi>Doubtleſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this is a maruellous thing, that yee</hi>

                  <p>It is no impeachment vnto our bleſſed Sauiours victory and triumph, that he humbled himſelfe to deſcend in ſoule into hell, the dreadfull priſon appointed for all impenitent ſinners. For as he triumphed ouer al his enemies on his croſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. So he was not daunted with the helliſh horrors of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dungeon, when he deſcended into hell, but victoriouſly
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1912:78"/> triumphed ouer them all. Yea, the more in his humane nature he was humbled, the more great and glorious was his victory, and triumph. It was <hi>Sampſons</hi> greater glory, that when he was incloſed in <hi>Aſſah,</hi> a ſtrong City of his enemies, he lifted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the poſts and barres of the gates of the City, and ſo ſet himſelfe free, and being bound with cords and ropes, brake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſunder, <hi>Iud.</hi> 16. So it was the greater glory of our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Sampſon,</hi> that being in body in the priſon of the graue, and in ſoule in the deepe dungeon of hell, yet he deliuered himſelfe from both at his glorious reſurrection. And as this was moſt glorious for Chriſt, ſo it was moſt profitable for vs, that place our whole hope and confidence in him. It is a confeſſed truth that whatſoeuer our bleſſed Sauiour performed in our humane nature, he performed it for vs. He fulfilled for vs all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, vnto the which heauen was due, and aſcended into heauen to take poſſeſſion thereof for vs, and to aſſure vs of our aſſumption into that place of aeternall happineſſe. So likewiſe he endured for vs whatſoeuer was agreeable to the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere Iuſtice of God to lay vpon him, in reſpect of all our ſins, and deſcended into hell, and deliuered himſelfe from thence, to aſſure vs that he had made ſatisfaction to the vttermoſt mite for all our debts, &amp; had procured for vs deliuerance from hell.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1912:78"/> Chriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead.</hi> That is to ſay, the righteouſnes that Chriſt hath fulfilled for all that beleeue in him (the which the Apoſtle calleth the righteouſneſſe of faith) aſſureth the faithfull that they need no more doubt of their aſcending into heauen, then of Chriſts aſcenſion, ſeeing he aſcended into heauen to take poſſeſſion thereof in their nature, and for their behoofe: nor of their deliuerance from hell, then of Chriſts deliuerance, ſeeing he deliuered himſelfe from thence, to aſſure them of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance. For the queſtion here handled by the Apoſtle, is not how we may be deliuered from the graue, or from a temporall death, and may be made partakers of a temporall life; but how we may be deliuered from that death that is indured in hell, and how we may be made pertakers of aeternall life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in the Kingdome of heauen. For obſerue the diſcourſe of the Apoſtle; The Law (ſaith he) ſaith; ſinne not at all, and thou needeſt not at all feare (not the graue but) hell, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appointed for the puniſhment of ſinne: and fulfill all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and thou needeſt not to doubt of thy comming to heauen, where righteouſneſſe dwelleth and raigneth for euer. But the righteouſnes performed for vs by Chriſt, &amp; obtained by faith, ſaith, <hi>No more doubt of thine aſcenſion into heauen then of Chriſts aſcenſion; nor of thy deliuerance from hell, then of Chriſts deliuerance: ſeeing whatſoeuer Chriſt hath done, he hath done it for them that are vnited vnto him by a true faith, and thereby haue full intereſt both in his ſufferings, and in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which he hath endured and performed for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then let me demand of any faithfull man, what greater aſſurance he can haue of his aſcenſion into heauen, then the aſcenſion of Chriſt, who aſcended thither, there to prepare a place for all his, as he himſelfe plainely teſtifieth, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 14. 2. So vpon the like conſequence may it alſo be demaunded, what greater aſſurance can a faithfull man haue for his deliuerance from hell, then this, that Chriſt being in hell before the grand executioner of the Lords vengeance for ſinne, in the priſon that was ordayned for thoſe debtors, that were no way able to make ſatisfaction, that Chriſt, I ſay, that was made ſinne for vs and our ſurety, and a debter in our roome, was deliuered from

Verily that reuerend man M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkins</hi> is of this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he hath deliuered in the expoſition of the Creed, that there cannot be any ſtronger euidence giuen vnto the faithfull, to aſſure them of their deliuerance from hell, then this, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> the Sonne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that went downe into the place of the damned, returned after this death from thence to liue in all heauenly happineſſe for euer.</p>

But we may rather reſolue, that both our Sauiour Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well witting to the weakneſſe of the faith of his deareſt ſeruants, would not omit the performance of that action, that he knew to be moſt auaileable to the confirmation thereof; nor the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts, the relation of the ſame in their Canonicall writings. For doth not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> making mention of Chriſts reſurrection, auouch that his ſoule was not left in hell the receptacle of ſoules, as well as that his body was not left in the graue being the place appointed for bodies ſubiect to corruption?</p>

Wherefore the Apoſtle to proue the truth of our Sauiours reſurrection, ſheweth out of the Prophet, that as his body was raiſed out of the place of corruption, ſo his ſoule was not left in hell, but brought backe againe from thence, that his reſurrection might be wrought thereby.

Now, to be contained in a place, and to be preſent in euery place, be things diuers and very diſlike. And therefore for ſo much as the word is euery where, &amp; the fleſh of Chriſt is not euery where, it is cleare that one and the ſelfe-ſame Chriſt is of both natures, that is, euery where according to the nature of his Diuinity,

                  </argument>
                  <p>The word of GOD is a more principall inſtrument of grace, then the Sacraments are. For otherwiſe our moſt wiſe and holy Sauiour, while he conuerſed in this world, would not haue wholly omitted the adminiſtration of Baptiſme, and <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 2. Luke 4. 16. 43. 1 Cor. 1. 17.</note> haue giuen himſelfe continually to the preaching of the word, and teſtified alſo that he was ſent for the diſpatch of that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Neither would he haue ſent forth his Apoſtles not ſo much to Baptiſe, as to preach the Goſpell; vnleſſe the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word had been the principall worke beſt befitting his principall Miniſters. Neither would the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> after that he himſelfe had ſo effectually preached to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 10. 42.</note> and his company, that the Holy Ghoſt fell on all that heard the word, haue commanded them to be baptized (and that in all likelihood by ſome inferiour Miniſter) in the name of the Lord, but would haue baptized them himſelfe. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Sacraments were added to the word; for the further ſtrengthening of the weake faith of the Beleeuers, and not for the confirming of the authority of the word, ſeeing from it they receiue their power and efficacy, when their right vſe is made knowen thereby. For how commeth it to paſſe that the water in Baptiſme, toucheth the body and cleanſeth the ſoule, but by the working of the word? Neither are the Sacraments ſo forcible inſtruments to bring Chriſt to vs, as the word is. The Goſpell (ſaith Saint <hi>Hierome)</hi> is the Body of Chriſt, and <note place="margin">Hieron. in Pſal. 147.</note> theſe words of our Sauiour <hi>(Except yee eate the fleſh of the Sonne of Man, and drinke his Bloud, yee ſhall haue no life in you)</hi> may be more rightly vnderſtood of the receiuing of Chriſt in the Word then in the Sacraments. And verily how was the whole world perſwaded to imbrace Chriſt? by the preaching of the Goſpell? or by the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments?</p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:1912:95"/>
                  <p>The truth is, that our moſt louing and gracious God, by his Euangelicall couenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull, and in him with all his ſpirituall ſeed, doth giue vnto them Chriſt Ieſus their Sauiour, and in him eternall life and bleſſedneſſe, and doth open and manifeſt the ſame by cauſing this his graunt to be ſet downe in the Goſpell written in the bookes of the Old and New Teſtament, as in the authenticall euidences thereof, and to be ſealed by the Sacraments, as by his owne ſeales, the which he hath ordained to be deliuered to his people, as his owne deedes by the hands of his faithfull and painfull Miniſters. Now which is the chiefe inſtrument to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie vnto the faithfull this gracious graunt? the deeds and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences themſelues, or the ſeales annexed thereto? that is, the Word or the Sacraments?

                  <p>Wherefore it ought not to be denyed, but that as God ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth ſome to ſaluation in Chriſt, and calleth them to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers thereof by a true faith, and preſerueth them thereby through his mighty power, that they neuer fall away from that happy eſtate, to the end that they ſhould aſcribe vnto him the whole glory of their eternall bleſſedneſſe: ſo likewiſe it cannot be iuſtly denyed, but that God leaueth other in their Infidelity and ſinne, to runne on wilfully and obſtinately in their owne demnable wayes, that ſo they might be forced to acknowledge and couſeſſe God to be moſt iuſt herein, and themſelues to be the totall cauſe of their owne deſtruction. <note place="margin">Sap. 5. 7.</note> For as euents, which in themſelues may or may not come to paſſe, are called co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tingent, for that they proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contingent cauſes, albeit they could not but come to paſſe as they were fore-ſeene and fore-appointed by the vnchangeable wiſedome and will of God: euen ſo all ſinfull actions, albeit they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to come to paſſe by his permiſſion, yet they are not to be ſaid to be wrought by his operation, and albeit

                  <p>Yea whereas they Father vpon diuerſe of the greateſt lights of the Church diuerſe Treatiſes that neuer came from them, as the Liturgies of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> S. <hi>Marke,</hi> S. <hi>Denis,</hi> and the like, and as the Decretall Epiſtles, fathered vpon divers ancient Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and produce out of them diverſe teſtimonies for the iuſtifying of diuerſe points of their Idolatry and ſuperſtition, hereby it is manifeſt that their cauſe is very bad, in that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee maintained but by ſuch counterfeit and forged evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly to conclude, if that the gouernours of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were not well witting to themſelues in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that the teſtimonie of God himſelfe deliuered in the bookes of the Canonicall Scriptures, was not directly againſt them, why doe they refuſe them as authenticall, &amp; as ſupreame iudges in thoſe tongues wherein they were firſt penned, by the ſpeciall and immediate revelation of the ſpirit of God, &amp; allow them that dignitie onely in the language of the vulgar Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, who was a man ſubiect to errour. And why doe they charge them being thus tranſlated to be obſcure, ambiguous, and doubtfull, and therevpon refuſe the Text it ſelfe to bee the ſupreame Iudge, vnleſſe it be taken in that ſenſe as it is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1912:116"/> by the Churches gloſſe, ſo making the gloſſe better then the text, and ſeating it in the place thereof.</p>

                  <p>Vndoubtedly, as it is a very ſtrong preſumption, that hee which diſgraceth the Lawes of his Prince is guilty of treſpaſſe committed againſt them, and ſo liable by them to condigne puniſhment: ſo is it an euident argument that many of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Church of Rome are condemned by the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scriptures, becauſe they are ſo diſgraced by her, deare children with diuerſe reproachfull imputations.</p>
